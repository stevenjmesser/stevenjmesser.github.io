        <title>The Navigation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Quarter four, 2018–19, is launched. Work scoped, backlogs filled, sprints begun. We pace ahead on GOV.UK. It’s been a really enjoyable week and, despite one blip, pretty easy-going. I’ve had to wrangle my calendar a little and so, in the spirit of being open, feel free to grab some time to chat about anything: &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendly.com/steve-messer/&quot;&gt;during work hours&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendly.com/stevenjmesser&quot;&gt;in the evening&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To everyone heading to UKGovCamp today, I hope you have tons of fun. Sad to be missing out but it’s my girlfriend’s birthday and needs must. To all weeknoters, old and new, &lt;a href=&quot;http://doodle.com/poll/97gbxrfms83wtf9b&quot;&gt;put your name down if you fancy a weeknotes meet-up in London&lt;/a&gt;. And I’m having a crack at publishing a newsletter, so check the Reading section for details on that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Four Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new team, Search Performance &amp;amp; Resilience, kicked off the quarter! We’re looking at three specific problems in the problem space: our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch&quot;&gt;Elasticsearch&lt;/a&gt; is out-of-support and needs upgrading; managing our clusters is costly on time and takes us away from feature work; and knowledge of Elasticsearch is low throughout the programme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our small but excellent team started by getting Elasticsearch 5.x and 6.x running on their local machines, importing data and noting the differences. This couldn’t have been done without the clear and detailed notes that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/katstevens&quot;&gt;Kat&lt;/a&gt; left us before Christmas, so we’ve a card on our backlog to say thanks to her. Having picked out the breaking changes between v2.x, v5.x and v6.x, we’re working out a plan for jumping to the latter version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve each acknowledged the blazing fast pace we’ve had this week, it’s a great feeling getting up to speed on the landscape so quickly. But once we get into the meaty work, I’ll be mindful to mention how we can’t always move fast. Tricky technical work deserves some thinking space, so metering everyone’s expectations upfront should hopefully mean no one laments slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main key result: performance and resilience is not degraded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other new team, Explore Personalisation, also kicked off the quarter! Our initial meeting provided us with a bunch of questions to answer, to help us work out the unknowns. Getting a feel for the problem space is one of the essential first steps for a product team, so we’ve lots of interviews and desk research lined up. As mentioned before, I’ll not go into too much detail on this work as it’s sensitive and we’ll be blogging about it (plus publishing our research for others to use).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product managing this work is important for me because, up until now, I’ve been on a very technical product team at GDS. This is a discovery with myriad possibilities, many loud opinions both in the team and battering us from external stakeholders, and balances vision leadership with the current climate around privacy ethics. My history on Platform Health risks me being pigeonholed as a technical product manager and, whilst I’m not afraid of getting into that complex work, this is a chance to showcase my other skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pulled out some questions to help us start forming a roadmap for core products. That’s mostly the applications in the publishing pipeline, authentication, other backends and some cross-product experiences that don’t sit elsewhere. As GOV.UK continues to scale, taking on more government bodies, publishers and serving more people, it’s going to need a bit of operationalisation and programme-wide strategy. For example, if our Publishing product group want to start doing fancy new things, we’ll need to guide them based on what’s possible now and where the overall platform is headed. We need to build up some data, research our colleagues and form a vision for where we’re headed in the coming weeks – that’s for next week though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned how techniques for dealing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/10/26/data-driven-decision-making-beware-of-the-hippo-effect/&quot;&gt;HiPPOs&lt;/a&gt; don’t always work. People whose bread and butter is making demands can’t be reasoned with during tense moments. This is where knowledge work rubs up against authority bias, where evidence and lean methods lose out to solutionism and senior demands. It’s bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having said that, we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; in unprecedented times and who’s to say that one way is the best to navigate through? It might be the case that features based on little evidence work, though I’ve not seen that happen often. People with a high degree of domain knowledge can often make instinctive decisions that turn out to be successes – Steve Jobs was great at this. But it’s hard to make reasoned, objective decisions in domains where one has very little knowledge of the intricacies and the environment. Strong product teams exist ‘to serve the [users], in ways that meet the needs of the [organisation]’, as Marty Cagan says in &lt;a href=&quot;https://svpg.com/empowered-product-teams/&quot;&gt;this piece&lt;/a&gt;, and they don’t operate well under ‘command and control’ management. So what’s does work? &lt;strong&gt;Trust.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m lucky to be paired with more of our excellent delivery managers this quarter, which has allowed me to experience some new delivery styles and learn a couple of facilitation methods. I’ll cover those in the post I’ve promised about how to kick off agile delivery teams and credit both Lee and James. Here’s thanks to them for this week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling myself out for snapping in a meeting, which is the first time I’ve done it at GDS. I was angry that our methods aren’t respected and colleagues were pushed against a wall, but that doesn’t make it OK. To be honest, almost every single meeting I’ve been in at GDS has been fine, nothing like the heated conversations you read about in other organisations, both public and private. I’d prefer to keep it that way though, so here’s to metering my own emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The New Cross</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Firebreak week, a time to make things better and get ready for next quarter. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1082944581472264192&quot;&gt;Platform Health sticker arrived&lt;/a&gt; too, which was bleeding great. Proud to have played a part in such an important mission of maintenance, glad they’re continuing on. Expect a post from Martin on why the team was set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week’s painting is completely unrelated to the week I had. It’s what it looked like at the end of my road in 1850.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/local-links-manager&quot;&gt;Local Links Manager&lt;/a&gt; is a tool we use at GOV.UK to maintain and update links to services on local authority websites. It was built quickly and is a good minimum viable product (MVP), but this week it needed a little more refinement work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat down with our Content Support team to take notes on their process, picking out the main pain points and where we could add value. By far the biggest time-hog was local authorities spending up to two months to return a spreadsheet with updated links. That’s likely because they were sent a CSV with 60,000 rows! So our first improvement was to add a button allowing teams to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/local-links-manager/pull/363&quot;&gt;download broken links for a council&lt;/a&gt;. This should mean that councils don’t need to filter the sheet they’re sent, it’s more easily workable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next big time-hog was updating links. This is done manually by Content Support amongst all their other work, it can take an entire day if they focus solely on updating links. This could be solved with an import feature, allowing them to upload a CSV of changed links, reducing their time spent on updating links to a couple of minutes. Unfortunately, due to illness, we didn’t have enough dev time to get this built but I’m hoping my good friends on Platform Health will consider taking it on – it’s a small card and a big plus for our operations budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local Links Manager is a good example of an MVP needing time to bed down before being iterated. The product was viable, but minimally so, and over the last 18 months of functioning well the areas for improvement became more apparent. It’s a lesson in giving products time to settle down, in beta and live phases. Once the gleam of newness has dulled, areas to be iterated will naturally appear from the new normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are looking good for the product community on GOV.UK. We got together with Leanne, Head of Product, to look at how we’re going to approach the year and a strategy will emerge in the next few weeks. We’ve been encouraged to come up with visions and strategies for our areas of the platform, and to be entrepreneurial in how we seek and justify new opportunities. I found this really invigorating as I’ve got some decent ideas on what could be done, so knowing there’s time to validate these and present cases for doing the work is really valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Handed the translations work over to Adam, the new associate product manager on Platform Health. He joined GDS three months ago and I’ve been buddying with him since he joined, as he was a Fast Streamer hired as a developer and put into a product role. He’s been devouring the resources and reading, and I was really impressed by his questions about the translation work and how he handled getting more information from our developers. He’s gonna do pretty well, I reckon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started putting together the objectives for my two missions this quarter: search performance and resilience, and exploring personalisation. I’ve been blessed with a good team on both fronts, and my delivery managers Lee and James both sent over slide decks for our kick-off meetings. I added some background info, details on the problem space and called out our objective on both decks, giving us time during the rest of the session to ask questions, work out what we know, set up an initial backlog and agree some key results as a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did start writing that guide I promised in &lt;a href=&quot;https://visitmy.website/2018/12/21/the-winter-solstice/&quot;&gt;S02E09&lt;/a&gt; on how to get teams started, but I’ll add what we get up this quarter too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Met with civic tech legend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/psd&quot;&gt;Paul Downey&lt;/a&gt;. He’s come up with some absolute classics that you’ll recognise: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/psd/status/568324759521501184&quot;&gt;the difference between waterfall and agile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/04/30/just-doodling-telling-the-story-with-a-few-pen-strokes/&quot;&gt;doodles about technology and teams&lt;/a&gt;, the discovery of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.registers.service.gov.uk&quot;&gt;GOV.UK Registers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/8451589322/in/album-72157633230231221/&quot;&gt;the unit of delivery is the team&lt;/a&gt;. So he’s a bit of a celebrity and I was really grateful he took time to chat with me. We spoke about open data (of course), some GOV.UK history, Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson, and what it’s like working with senior stakeholders. That last bit was hugely valuable for me – probably the most valuable five minutes in recent weeks. If you, dear reader, would like to advise me on how to work well with Big Wigs, please get in touch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week was the first time I’ve observed the delta of seniority. I was gifted wisdom from someone senior to me, and it was useful. But the teaching I’ve tried to give someone junior to me has, seemingly, paid off in part. I’ve never been a line manager before but would certainly be interested now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got a bit meeting-logged on Monday. Too many short meetings that took the entire half an hour, not giving me enough time to work my notes into something sensible. So I could do better at giving myself buffer time between meetings. That’s hard when people demand your time through Google Calendar and it doesn’t support buffer time. Maybe there’s something on Zapier I could use.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Limbo Continues</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re still in the fallow period, but it has been a boon: loose ends tied, histories written, new ships prepared for departure. Writing reviews of 2018 has been popular this week, and I’ve enjoyed reading pieces by new weeknoters. This weekend I’ll try to find the time to have a little retro of these first two series of my weeknotes, make the most of the continuing limbo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;three-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Three Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the quarter has already ended and this week demanded nothing urgent (for a change), I spent a day continuing to document the last three months. This consisted of going through the Trello board, picking out the cards related to our OKRs, i.e. not business-as-usual cards to support the platform, and writing up a narrative on Confluence telling future colleagues what we did, why, and what we learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t rewrite the details of the cards on Confluence, simply linked to the cards, because that would have taken hours. That troubled me because – as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jonodrew&quot;&gt;Jonathan&lt;/a&gt; pointed out – Trello isn’t a permanent record of anything. Hopefully it will persist in the immediate future but it’s certainly time to look at writing product decision records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking to users is an important aspect of good product work, as is talking to your team. This week I spoke with two users – a local authority and HM Courts &amp;amp; Tribunals Service (HMCTS) – about some issues they’d had; and Bruce, tech lead on the upcoming search work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually contact with users would be handled over email but it’s not always an ideal communication channel. I’ve used phone calls in my previous role to quickly catch up with users, it’s more immediate, and it tends improve our rapport with users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, it’s a great way to open up your pipeline for new work. Emails can be very direct, whereas verbal conversations cover more ground. For example, I was able to find out how HMCTS use one of our publishing tools, the steps they take, why they use that process and the steps they take in other similar workflows – all inside 5 minutes. That meant I was able to address their issue immediately and gather useful context to consider improvements. It’s not always possible or necessary, granted, but quick contact would help lubricate our support processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a chat with Bruce to field any questions was great too. When he first requested the meeting, I made sure to pull together everything we’d already done and make it available to him. He took a read through and said he felt really good about it, as we’ve had much of the work shaped by Kat from Digital Marketplace who’s upgraded Elasticsearch before. Considering we were rather in the dark three months ago, we’re in a really strong position now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also caught up with Leanne, Head of Product for GOV.UK, about the discovery into personalisation we’re doing in the upcoming quarter. I’ll not speak about that on my weeknotes as I’m intending to blog about it regularly. I’d also like us to publish the research and reports openly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fail to prepare, prepare to fail, etc. It works. Although perhaps I’m &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/10-product-development-traps-2de02bc358bd&quot;&gt;overestimating the alignment from one meeting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After pitching my firebreak session, someone raised a challenge and I replied with a stumbled ‘Errr…’. I think I should compose myself more during those moments, I’m afraid I looked shook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reading&quot;&gt;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>The Fallow Period</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A short week at work, being only Christmas Eve and one day of The Gooch – the bit between Christmas and New Year that’s a bit empty but definitely has purpose. Spent most of it either wrapping up the quarter or walking in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gojauntly.app.link/FJdpLwifZS?_p=f34a264cea2ade7e638208&quot;&gt;West Midlands&lt;/a&gt; and Wales (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gojauntly.app.link/il3YL5Yf1S?_p=f34a264cea2ade7e638208&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stevenjmesser/status/1079046602940141568&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;two-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Two Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this (though it was only a 2-day week)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As there will be a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/associate-product-manager-skills-they-need/associate-product-manager-skills-they-need&quot;&gt;associate product manager&lt;/a&gt; replacing me on Platform Health, I spent a few hours packaging up a project I’d made a start on but can’t continue. Translations on GOV.UK give departments the ability to share information in languages other than English, which due to the platform’s organic growth isn’t a function that’s handled consistently by the various publishing applications. Since we have a few issues with translations to be solved, it’s worthwhile looking at how we can make it better everywhere rather than fixing bit-part problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’ll be a good first project for them to sink their teeth into, a meaty technical problem – allowing them to explore the stack and the idiosyncracies of applications – which can be fixed by focusing on delivering value to users. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs&quot;&gt;Starting with user needs&lt;/a&gt; will mean they can check on whether we’ve delivered enough for users already, as this hasn’t been looked at holistically before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote up what we’d managed to achieve this quarter and it’s quite a bit. There had been a few headline metrics such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2018/11/28/making-sure-users-see-updates-caching/&quot;&gt;making content appear 10x sooner for users&lt;/a&gt;, reducing the publishing queues by 45 per cent and improving publishing latency by 25 per cent. But after digging into our metrics a little more, the improvements haven’t been wholly consistent and there’s still a few fluctuations to take account of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that the team hasn’t been successful. Though we set ourselves the task of improving the publishing pipeline, we don’t own it and the actions of other teams have influence on it. We’ve been successful in finding root causes and addressing those through code, but it’s time to take a look at some principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I regret not having been able to set service level objectives (&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@asuffield/thinking-about-slos-64841737d1ed&quot;&gt;SLOs&lt;/a&gt;) for the user experience on GOV.UK. It was my main aim at the beginning of the quarter but holiday and urgent EU Exit projects got in the way. It started off with a prioritisation of Jobs-to-be-Done on GOV.UK and setting SLOs for scheduling publications, but the body of work needs to be completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t get precious about the effect of your code on shared infrastructure. It’s better to be precious about the principles you set for everyone who shares it. One to run past &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.probablyfine.co.uk/about.html&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt; when we next have coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a 2-day week, it’s hard to improve on answering emails and writing up organisation knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reading List Picks of 2018</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a heck of a year. I got to fulfill a teenage dream and start working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk&quot;&gt;an important and much-used website&lt;/a&gt;, which got me thinking about product management, people, work and the World Wide Web more than  I did last year. Here’s a bunch of articles and blog posts that piqued my interest throughout 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-build-a-low-tech-website&quot;&gt;How to Build a Low-tech Website?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low-tech Magazine looks at the sustainability of the modern world and its practices. They decided to practice what they preach by making their website run entirely on solar power, using web design techniques to reduce energy consumption and a self-built solar power bank to run it all – no data centres and CDNs in sight. Though it occasionally goes offline when there’s not enough power, the article really got me thinking about the ‘always on’ nature of the Web and how that’s quite wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website.html&quot;&gt;How to Build a Low-tech Website?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bullshit-web&quot;&gt;The Bullshit Web&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein to Low-tech Magazine, Nick Heer wrote about the ballooning bullshit of data on the Web and the wastefulness of filling your 17MB/s internet connection with ads. It’s an essay on what the Web was meant to be, and what it has become; and how the Information Superhighway could benefit from those of us working on it to take more responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-cognition-crisis&quot;&gt;The Cognition Crisis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waking up and checking your phone. Scrolling through Facebook while the telly’s on. Notifications causing drivers to kill people. Adam Gazzaley argues that ‘our constant engagement with technology interferes with the pursuit of other behaviors critical for maintaining a healthy mind’, and it caused me to turn on Do Not Disturb when at work. We have natural animal minds that are being pushed to the edge by the environment we’ve built around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-principles-that-make-me-a-better-product-manager&quot;&gt;The principles that make me a better product manager&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing that’s central to the practice of product management, it’s a set of principles one can call on in any situation. A good principle can keep everyone on course but also help point the way forward in unfamiliar waters. Ross Ferguson left us with seven principles before he was poached by the Canadians, and they’ve really helped me in my first year at Government Digital Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thinking-about-slos&quot;&gt;Thinking about SLOs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working out how to maintain and operate a behemoth like GOV.UK was pretty daunting when I joined Platform Health. Adopting a Service Level Objective and thinking about how we manage technical solutions from a users-first perspective has been massively helpful. I’m really grateful that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emilylabram&quot;&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt; posted this by Andrew Suffield – one-time Site Reliability Engineer at Google – and for all her work on spreading SLO thinking at GDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;teams-from-scratch--part-1-psychological-safety&quot;&gt;Teams from Scratch – Part 1: Psychological Safety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a culture where asking questions and admitting gaps in knowledge is OK can be hard, but this piece popped up serendipitously around the time I was doing a lot of thinking on team-building. It turned out that Alex worked at Unruly, an adtech company which shares our office building, and we’ve been meeting for coffee ever since!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@probablyfine/teams-from-scratch-part-1-psychological-safety-ea43d46cdbc6&quot;&gt;Teams from Scratch – Part 1: Psychological Safety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-did-privacy-come-to-be-enshrined-as-a-human-right&quot;&gt;How did privacy come to be enshrined as a human right?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this year of our Lord, 2018, when the General Data Protection Regulation was enshrined in law, no doubt many of us were thinking &lt;em&gt;Why on earth are we going through all this pain?&lt;/em&gt; Preparing for GDPR was a huge undertaking, and despite the boring spreadsheets and confusing issues around compliance, I think it’s largely a Good Thing. This series by Projects by IF traces the history of our right to privacy and the role of regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;microdosing-isnt-a-shortcut-to-professional-success&quot;&gt;Microdosing Isn’t a Shortcut to Professional Success&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being employed in Tech, with working weeks called ‘sprints’, can often feel like you’re &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; running a race, and open plan offices can dwindle your focus. Some people turn to microdosing – taking small amounts of psychoactive drugs – to find a balance, but Erica Avey argues that perhaps we should change the way we work, not our biology. This article applies to coffee as much as it does to LSD, in my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;weeknotes-styles&quot;&gt;Weeknotes styles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I started writing weeknotes, a weekly reflection on my working week, and I’ve found the practice really beneficial. It’s like a personal retrospective, giving you a chance to package up the week and move on, making improvements. I recommend it to a lot of people I meet, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stamanfar&quot;&gt;Sam&lt;/a&gt; wrote this piece on the different styles the &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es&quot;&gt;Web of Weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; community uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;this-isnt-for-everyone&quot;&gt;This isn’t for everyone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What surprised me most when I joined GDS was that many of our products didn’t have defined user personas. Nor did we say who we wouldn’t build things for. Not all users are equal. The mindset of building for everyone is helpful in not excluding certain groups, but it can widen the scope of a product too much. The Parliament Data team, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fantasticlife&quot;&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; in particular, have been good in acknowledging that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;democratic-technical-debt&quot;&gt;Democratic technical debt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital government has surged forth leaving improved services in its wake. But how much of the enhancements are only surface-deep? ‘If you don’t consider what the long term impact of how you build something is, you’re accruing democratic technical debt,’ author Alex Blandford says. While also positing that terrific idea, Alex also points out that, well, government has been a bit shit at providing the research it has conducted. A few blog posts ain’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-personal-resilience-or-how-to-avoid-burnout&quot;&gt;Building personal resilience (or how to avoid burnout)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year has been hectic, and it’s possible for work to become all-consuming if you’re not careful. What helped me avoid that was to draw a line between my professional and personal lives: I used weeknotes to package up the week, and I used personal time to replenish my mind and soul. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pippapeasland&quot;&gt;Pippa&lt;/a&gt; takes a great perspective on how to do that in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March, I stopped using Facebook to see whether I’d miss it. It wasn’t a problem at all, in fact there’s not a single feature I longed for, so I deleted my account. That’s mostly been driven by their abysmal record for privacy in recent months and their involvement in the Cambridge Analytica atrocity. I’ve read countless articles on Facebook this year, but these two stand out. One shows us how advertising has been a misplaced driver for social media firms, and the other reminds us how the Web worked before the 2.0 giants took over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;this-is-how-we-workgive-or-take&quot;&gt;This is how we work…give or take&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jukesie&quot;&gt;Matt Jukes&lt;/a&gt; is a legend of the civic tech space, a dynamo of humble magnificence with a Bristol accent – an honest, friendly, earnest kind of bloke. So of course he wrote an open piece on how he works, which caused people from all across the public sector (and others) to write one too. It’s a fascinating to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;empowered-product-teams&quot;&gt;Empowered Product Teams&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post covers much of Marty Cagan’s talk when he visited us in September. It’s a long read but it’s absolutely essential for organisations scaling up, past the startup mindset. It reminds us that qualities of leadership can be better than management, and that great teams are full of ordinary people.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Winter Solstice</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Not a bad week to round off 2018, and Winter Solstice is the perfect day to look ahead. I’m going to be working over Christmas so this series hasn’t ended yet, but this week was definitely a major milestone. It’s time to tie off some loose ends and prepare for 2019, as next year will be hectic. Hopefully my weeknotes won’t suffer as a result but since &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es&quot;&gt;people who are busier and better than me&lt;/a&gt; manage it, I’ll always have them to turn to for advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kicked off &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; new team, although not one that I’ll be managing from day to day. Its mission is to look at another of our key results in Platform Health, a particularly risky one around EU Exit, ensuring that we can handle a spike in departments publishing content concurrently. It’s a pretty complex space trying to work out the efficiencies of a distributed publishing pipeline of micro-services, but we made a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/steventux&quot;&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt; is Tech Lead which is perfect, as he’s an excellent full stack developer who has a deep knowledge of www.gov.uk and how it has evolved over time. After talking through the mission and setting an objective, I covered some of the cards we’d completed in other sprints, spikes into how we’d collect data on publishing activity and how we’d replay that to the pipeline. The biggest hurdle to overcome was figuring out how to replay fake publishing events, and Steve’s managed to use Gatling to do that. That’s a huge achievement and means the mission can actually progress now. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible. We’re not sure whether to use Gor or logs data to replicate publishing events but that’s something to look at next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should probably write a full guide on how I kick off a digital team in government. I’ve done it twice in the last three weeks, beyond the usual quarter kick-offs for Platform Health, and a few elements worked really well, so it’d be good to have those to turn to. No doubt others out there could add their tidbits too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We deployed all the OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE stuff we’d been working on, so that people and businesses can find information on how exiting the EU will affect them. There’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://euexit.campaign.gov.uk&quot;&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; which points to new content on www.gov.uk, all of which has been through rapid cycles of prototyping, user testing and iteration. A journalist put out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/1075701805521231873&quot;&gt;red-hot take&lt;/a&gt; that UK government was trying to catch up to the Dutch government, as the Dutch did a similar-but-not-the-same thing a few months ago, although the Dutch one spits out a PDF of information that could change. Ours, however, can be updated as policy develops and you can subscribe to email alerts about changes specific to your context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that aside, it’s testament to our ways of working and the value that GOV.UK provides that we’re able to design, build and release these useful tools and information inside of four weeks. It would have been released sooner had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46509288&quot;&gt;the vote on the deal in Parliament&lt;/a&gt; not been delayed. So ignoring the political situation and what we were delivering, it turns out that being lean and agile works for making stuff happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the middle of that day, a day of team ceremonies and the EU Exit Deployathon, I had an interview. Having been worried about it last week, GDS came to their senses and scheduled an interview before Christmas. I made sure to talk about things I had done rather than what we had done as a team, because they called me out on that at HMRC. It went well, I bigged myself up, and they did tons of nodding. But mostly I’ll cherish having casually strolled into an interview during some important, stressful work. (I know that’s very egotistical but it is quite rare, let me bask in it!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chatted with other PMs and our new Head of Product, Leanne, about our missions for next quarter. I’m leaving my work-family, Platform Health, to start two new teams: Search &amp;amp; Finders Resilience, continuing the work we did on dynamic content performance; and Personalisation, looking at whether users want personalised experiences and how that might benefit them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on Personalisation is going to be great. We’ve got the Head of User Insights, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Imeh_Akpan&quot;&gt;Imeh&lt;/a&gt;, and Senior Service Designer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KateIW&quot;&gt;Kate&lt;/a&gt;, working with us, two of the most talented folk on GOV.UK. Plus Leanne was massively involved in personalisation at Sky, so she’ll have some good ideas, but it’s working with stakeholders that I’m also really excited about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users have a mental model around giving government their personal data, which can largely be summarised by ‘ERM, NO F***ING WAY’. That’s going to be our first thing to explore, as it’s the major blocker to personalisation ever being a thing. Despite some senior civil servants, MPs and &lt;a href=&quot;https://policyexchange.org.uk/publication/the-smart-state/&quot;&gt;think tanks&lt;/a&gt; saying that GOV.UK needs this feature, we don’t much like spending taxpayers’ money on things they don’t need – so we’ll validate that first. On top of that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gansenthi&quot;&gt;Ganesh&lt;/a&gt; and I will be doing a side project on the Semantic Web and Linked Data, to get GOV.UK into the shape it really needs to be. If you’re reading this and I know you &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you have worked on Semantic technologies in the past, expect to receive an email soon. (But if you’re a Semantic person and I don’t know you, please drop me a line!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it’s a little sad to be leaving Platform Health, I’m looking forward to working on a UX product after 9 months in the technical trenches. It’s going to be in good hands though, and they’ve got more complex work coming up that I can follow from the other side of the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and it turns out the interview went well. They offered me the promotion and I’m going to take it, because I really like working on that website. An early Christmas present!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That 2019 may be even more exciting and move more quickly than 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week was absolutely fine, but I’m going to have to get anal about managing my time and focus. With so many plates to spin, I’ll need to work hard to make sure we meet all our objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Gift</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Another sterling week working at pace on important problems. One of our senior product managers, Antonia, went on maternity leave this week and said she hoped I’d be around when she returned. I told her I probably would be: ‘Turning up to work is fun now, it’s not just a job.’ I am &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; lucky to be able to say that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Four Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We met our objective and finished the spin-up mission in 6 days. It’s a great achievement for everyone, especially pulling together in such a short space of time and, for much of the team, working on a new product. What was most impressive was how each person brought forward their own expertise, adding a unique and valuable facet to our research, testing and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though we had three developers on the team, they covered hardware, computer science and creativity in code well. Our technical architect, Vitalie, was great in looking at the underlying, latent issues too, putting forward cards that prompted us to explore our support model. This was particularly great for me because I was about to ask him to do that, but he’d come about that slice of work through his own volition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was my first time working closely with a performance analyst too, which I really relished. Being able to ask product questions and getting evidence in return, evidence to support our endeavours, was fantastic. And my delivery manager, Nila, has been excellent in supporting the team and keeping things moving. She’s been so great that we’re going to see more of her next quarter. Woo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday we hooked up with my other team, Platform Health, to run through some load-testing. We were really pleased to see that the three short-term optimisations we’d made had had an effect, allowing us to serve 400 unique users per second for 20 consecutive minutes. There’s still more to be done to work out when it’ll fall over, but we’ve removed the most immediate risk – the rest is just long-term optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jen, Head of GOV.UK, raised a prescient point during one of our catch-ups. There’s been some trepidation in Government Digital Service about how the organisation will be treated in next year’s spending review, the worry being that we might have less budget to do more things. What we’ve been doing over the past few weeks, delivering beneficial work for the country at a considerable pace during an unprecedented period, has really impressed Cabinet Office (apparently) and Government as a whole to show them what we’re capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our work has upheld the GDS principles and elements of the Service Standard, which just goes to prove the way we work and that transformation hasn’t finished, we’ve just entered a second age. We can all be really proud of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time, I had to give a firm ‘No’ to someone senior at GDS. It was a simple case of solutionising, really, and so quite easy to shift and redirect towards the desired outcome, but it’s uncommon to need to do it. They had proposed that a retention period should be applied to blog posts and that we could remove them after &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; years. That goes completely against the point of blogging in government and reeks of newspeak: we don’t alter history to make it fit the narrative we want to tell. We’re open, honest and accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it turned out they were just worried about GDPR compliance and ensuring that people could exercise their right to have personal data removed, which I found out after some digging. I explained the platform, how it works and why we have it, then showed how their different policies apply to different sections of the platform and blogging activity. They saw how to reach their outcome then, so we’re updating the privacy notice and internal HR policies. A good improvement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday was a busy day with two interviews: one at HMRC, one phone interview at GDS. Both went really well, and I got along with everyone in the HMRC interview. Their work in London is particularly interesting, using product management practices to help shape policy – avant-garde work in government, if you ask me! I’m hoping that GDS pull their finger out and arrange a face-to-face interview next week, should I be successful, rather than waiting until after Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continued to learn how to work with team members from diverse backgrounds and with different emotional needs. Looking forward to hearing comments from people in our remote retro, so I can learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to say without that retro, to be honest, we’ve been so immediately focussed on the work in front of us, there hasn’t been time to think about much else.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Spin Up</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The most fun I’ve had at work in a week on record. We’re doing work which sings to the vision of GOV.UK, making information about government and services simple, clearer and faster. Can’t knock it really, though it’s a heck of a change of pace from lying on the beach last week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Four Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the honour of spinning up a brand new sub-team. If you don’t count the outsourced teams I’ve run and looking after Platform Health while Martin’s off, this is my first time leading a multidisciplinary team at GDS – and I’m loving it. Staying aware of emotional energy while also having open conversations about delivering value for users is hugely enjoyable, especially when you have a team of excellent people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a quick kick-off on Tuesday from our lead technical architect, Tim, who explained that our team would be looking after dynamic content performance, the fourth of Platform Health’s OKRs that I set with Martin at the start of the quarter. After taking them through the technical introduction to GOV.UK’s architecture, I disbanded the group and set up to meet the following day at 9 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We grouped at 10 a.m. on Wednesday and spent pretty much the entire day defining our mission: the objective, what success would look like, our ways of working, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window&quot;&gt;Johari Window&lt;/a&gt; to start building a roadmap. By 4 p.m. we had a team charter, a roadmap, a prioritised backlog and a set of cards to tackle the following day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aditya, one of our developers on the new sub-team, is profoundly deaf and working with him has been a real eye-opener. It hasn’t been that hard to bear his needs in mind, and I’m making sure to address him directly and speak clearly, but it does change the pace of conversation some times. It makes us more metered and considered, if anything, as more effort needs to go into how one conducts oneself. We’re also filling in a doc before and after daily ceremonies too, so that he can read through the morning’s stand-up or the afternoon’s playback if he’s working from home. That’s one element I really like, having a record of what I said to check against what I manage to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aditya is very pleasant to work with too, a gracious person who’s always smiling. We’ve a very considerate working culture at GDS but anyone would be hard pushed to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; change their working patterns for him! Top bloke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tijmenbr&quot;&gt;Tijmen&lt;/a&gt;, our tech lead, had dived headlong into the new work with Jon, another developer on the team whom we’ve borrowed from the Observe team. Following a quick run-through of dynamic content applications on GOV.UK, they got started on looking into previous load-testing we’d done on Platform Health. They were able to quickly identify opportunities for optimisations, adding &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alphagov/finder-frontend/pull/722&quot;&gt;HTTP caching&lt;/a&gt; and content caching where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tests on that pull request show an improvement on one Finder being able to serve 16x more requests with zero errors. The change was deployed later on that day and Tijmen put together a Grafana dashboard, to show the effect across all Finders and search pages on average, which I’ve been watching throughout most of Friday. It has reduced the number of requests being served by finder-frontend by 17%, widening the bottleneck and shifting the load onto our internal caches and the content delivery network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All within two days. Working at this rate, in a fast cycle, and achieving these results is testament to our working practice. It’s moments like this when you realise just what we can achieve in a short space of time with determination, skill and good frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got an interview at HMRC on Friday – woo! No news of the GDS PM interviews yet, but we’ll see what becomes of those. They’ve been delayed for quite a while now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That I’m capable of leading a team…for a few days, anyway. Here’s hoping the next two weeks go just as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would have been better if I’d foreseen needing to spend the entirety of Wednesday with the new sub-team, rather than thinking I could juggle that and Platform Health too. That was naïve of me, but there weren’t any ill effects on the team so perhaps it’s not such a huge deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reading&quot;&gt;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read through a boat-load of stuff on holiday, here’s a selection of the best bits. There’s a very particular theme, perhaps based on the fact I was reading Douglas Rushkoff’s &lt;em&gt;Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus&lt;/em&gt; at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This is how I work…give or take</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dasbarrett&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt; wanted to see how I work, so here’s what I do, based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jukesie&quot;&gt;Jukesie’s&lt;/a&gt; rip-off of the Lifehacker ‘How I Work’ series. Other public service folk have written about &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jukesie/this-is-how-we-work-give-or-take-6c8964cac85f&quot;&gt;how they work&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;: London, UK.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Current gig&lt;/strong&gt;: Associate product manager, Government Digital Service.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Current mobile device&lt;/strong&gt;: Samsung J5 for work, iPhone 8 for percy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Current computer&lt;/strong&gt;: MacBook Air 13” for work. Mac Mini at home. Some hobby Raspberry Pis and a PC too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;One word that best describes how you work&lt;/strong&gt;: Metered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-of-all-tell-us-a-little-about-your-background-and-how-you-got-to-where-you-are-today&quot;&gt;First of all, tell us a little about your background and how you got to where you are today&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liked books and computers growing up. Spent a huge portion of my teenage years in my bedroom, tinkering on the Web or with computers. But I also enjoyed writing stories. Aged 16, I decided to focus on my Literature studies instead of Information Technology. It seemed to have…more prestige.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did my A-levels, went to Bath Spa Uni to study Creative Writing. Bought a Mac to stop me playing video games. It worked, and I had a lot of fun. The course was excellent with great teachers – check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/schools/liberal-arts/interest-areas/creative-writing/creative-writing-publications/&quot;&gt;some of the authors who’ve also studied at Bath Spa&lt;/a&gt; – and I had my sights set on a career in publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graduated. Spent the next year continuing cheffing, then quit to get some work experience and make the most of my degree. Spent two weeks as a managing editorial assistant at Vintage Publishing (part of Random House) and was asked back for another week. A few months later, there’s an open position as an editorial assistant and they ask me to apply. Incredibly, I get it and dive into the literary publishing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do that for 9 months. Move on to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguin.co.uk/company/publishers/vintage/jonathan-cape.html&quot;&gt;Jonathan Cape&lt;/a&gt;, attend a Booker Prize ceremony in my first week. It’s quite glitzy, maybe too glitzy, especially for a working class boy from Wolverhampton. I get the chance to work with some of the most eminent, prolific literary authors in the world. They even let me commission &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/109/1093783/finally-my-ambulance/9780099575870.html&quot;&gt;a book of short stories&lt;/a&gt;. But I feel massively out of my depth and haven’t been to Oxbridge, like most others at my level. Self-doubt sets in. Work is naught but toil. I grow tired of the sausage factory. I quit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I have a breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clouds pass after 6 months and I get a job at NOW TV, which was just starting out. See Agile and software development in action. Turns out that’s quite glitzy too, except I didn’t know that at school. IT is kind of cool now. &lt;em&gt;Hmm, maybe I could do tech after all.&lt;/em&gt; After some time in Operations, they initiate a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/transfers-takeovers&quot;&gt;TUPE process&lt;/a&gt; for an entire department and I need to find other work. &lt;a href=&quot;http://porism.com&quot;&gt;Porism&lt;/a&gt; has an opening for someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I focus on increasing engagement and use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://lginformplus.local.gov.uk&quot;&gt;LG Inform Plus&lt;/a&gt;, then get the chance to redesign and launch a new version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ecasework.com&quot;&gt;eCasework&lt;/a&gt;. We spent a year on that before it went live. Take-up wasn’t good. I wrestled with marketing techniques, sales, developing some features and trying to talk to the few users we had. Wasn’t really sure what I was doing. It was…enjoyable, but also like banging my head against a brick wall. Repeatedly. Every day. Because I’m leading myself blind. (However, I also learn some cool stuff about open data, local government and generally learn tons from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MikeThacker&quot;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explaining my anguish to a friend, he suggests that I’m kind of doing product management. I read a few blogs, try out the techniques, and they work. &lt;em&gt;Hmm, maybe I could do tech after all.&lt;/em&gt; Attending the product management course at General Assembly gives me new skills. We start to grow eCasework and its user base. We develop features that people love. But I’m a bit hungry for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apply for a job working on GOV.UK. They offer it to me. I’m overjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I’m just really, really happy. I’m at home. I’m back in my bedroom, tinkering on the Web and with computers, on a piece of the national infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;take-us-through-a-recent-workday&quot;&gt;Take us through a recent workday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a T-shaped structure to my week which I try to stick to. Mornings are for product thinking, writing cards or catching up on important emails, except on Wednesdays when I’ll meet &lt;a href=&quot;undefined&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt; for coffee. Then it’s a catch-up with Delivery Manager and Tech Lead, followed by stand-up with the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the rest of the day is either meetings, team ceremonies or community meet-ups with other product managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays are a bit lighter: product thinking, analysing data and trends, and chats with other specialists, often dappled with the odd meeting here and there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of what actually happens can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/@stevenjmesser&quot;&gt;my weeknotes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-apps-gadgets-or-tools-cant-you-live-without&quot;&gt;What apps, gadgets or tools can’t you live without?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; Reminders, my philosopher’s stone at work. With simple commands, I can remind myself or a colleague to do something. Need I say more? Since I have the app on my iPhone too, I can capture those work-related thoughts that spring up in the shower, at dinner or when I’m on holiday. It gets things out of my head, and only brings them back when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpocket.com&quot;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt; a fair amount to save blogs to read. Medium’s Reading List also comes in handy, but I’m trying to move away from the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, too. It’s the app I use most. To both fill time productively and waste it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mysocialsummary.com&quot;&gt;My Social Summary&lt;/a&gt; is great for catching up on Twitter without needing to scroll through Twitter. It looks for the most engaging tweets from lists you’ve built and sends you a daily digest. Definitely worth £3 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve really taken to Post-it notes as a to-do list. I tried Trello but you’re not always able to add cards in meetings or ceremonies. Post-its are always at hand in GDS, so I can quickly capture sudden thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here’s some &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@stevenjmesser/my-bootstrapped-stack-dca24da282cd&quot;&gt;stuff I’ve used at work&lt;/a&gt; before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-your-best-shortcut-or-life-hack&quot;&gt;What’s your best shortcut or life hack?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have to do something three times, automate it. If you can’t automate it, find a way to reduce the toil. You’ll immediately create more time to spend on things that really need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;take-us-through-an-interesting-unusual-or-finicky-process-you-have-in-place-at-work&quot;&gt;Take us through an interesting, unusual, or finicky process you have in place at work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you forget your work pass, you can’t get through many of the (mostly glass) doors. You end up staring forlornly at the people on the other side, who don’t know whether to let you in &lt;em&gt;sans&lt;/em&gt; ID. Sometimes several people walk past before you’re permitted to exit your dimension of uselessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t worked out how to capitalise on this yet. It’s &lt;em&gt;a bit&lt;/em&gt; like a cigarette break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-you-keep-track-of-what-you-have-to-do&quot;&gt;How do you keep track of what you have to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said earlier, Slack Reminders and Post-it notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-your-favourite-side-project&quot;&gt;What’s your favourite side project?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently playing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; to refresh my &lt;a href=&quot;https://visitmy.website&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and move blog posts away from Medium. But I’m also running out of kimchi so will have to make some more of that soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-you-currently-reading-or-what-do-you-recommend-to-read&quot;&gt;What are you currently reading, or what do you recommend to read?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m reading &lt;em&gt;Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus&lt;/em&gt; by Douglas Rushkoff for non-fiction, and &lt;em&gt;Memoirs of Hadrian&lt;/em&gt; by Marguerite Yourcenar for fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-else-would-you-like-to-see-answer-these-questions&quot;&gt;Who else would you like to see answer these questions?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MikeThacker&quot;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Ellayanor&quot;&gt;Ellie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pr0bablyfine&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johncutlefish&quot;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emilylabram&quot;&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/femkesvs&quot;&gt;Femke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-the-best-advice-youve-ever-received&quot;&gt;What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘You can do whatever you want in life, as long as you don’t hurt anyone.’ Oh, and: ‘Work is just a way to pay the bills, but it helps if you enjoy it.’ Both from my dad.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Wind Down</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A four-day week spent closing open loops. Took yesterday off to pack for my holiday which I’m really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; looking forward to – especially because it’s supposed to drop to 1°C next week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;four-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Four Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;undefined&quot;&gt;John Cutler&lt;/a&gt; spared us an hour to chat product, and it was really beneficial. We talked quite a bit about valuing non-feature work, how it’s important and continuous improvement needs to happen under the hood too. That sort of work is our main focus on Platform Health, really, and selling it to ‘the business’ isn’t too hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how this work is described by senior teams can irk me. Platform work is often referred to as ‘keeping the lights on’, but it’s really much more than that: it’s chopping wood, filling buckets, building aqueducts…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John mentioned Cost of Delay and it’s a useful prism to view all platform work through. &lt;em&gt;Does the value opened up by doing this story diminish over time?&lt;/em&gt; That sort of thinking allows you to take on anything urgent and create value in the short term while also keeping an eye on the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had check-in with the programme team on Wednesday, or at least we were supposed to have check-in with them. The majority of them weren’t there, which was a let down as we had some important things to tell them. Really frustrating when you’ve had to work through lunch to get the presentation together too, because there’s so little time on Tuesdays and Wednesdays what with all the meetings. And putting the slides together on Monday would miss 20 per cent out of the last two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite that, our new Head of Product, Leanne, was there in force and tried her best to accommodate us. She was pleased with our progress and some of the optimisations we’ve brought to the publishing pipeline, wanting to push us to show it off. I’m really keen to get the team showing off what they’ve done because, as I always say, it’s not sexy work but it’s damn-near as important as building features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The excellent &lt;a href=&quot;undefined&quot;&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt; gave our team a run-down of SLIs, SLOs and SLAs – henceforth known as SLXs – and how they can create psychological safety in our work. We’ve had a go at creating one already (which I covered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/the-delivery-93a08085cc32&quot;&gt;S02E03&lt;/a&gt;) and this was included in her slides, which meant to work was framed much better than I had introduced it to them. As Emily spoke about the noise of alerting and how to make alerts more meaningful, there was lots of nodding amongst the group. It certainly hit home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to be looking at building SLOs for the other jobs of GOV.UK soon, once some important Brexity business is out of the way. In lieu of an actual stress-test of the pipeline, making our current data more meaningful will provide a decent, actionable contingency for the months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darren Barnes from ONS came to talk about and demonstrate the amazing &lt;a href=&quot;https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/guidance/the-gss-data-project/&quot;&gt;GSS Data&lt;/a&gt; project. Using linked data principles and technologies such as concept schemes, triple stores, URIs and all that other stuff, they’ve pulled together a neat open data portal that allows you to find statistics about stuff. It was super impressive, and it was nice to hear that they held &lt;a href=&quot;undefined&quot;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt;’s work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://about.esd.org.uk/about&quot;&gt;ESD and LG Inform&lt;/a&gt; in high regard – as an exemplar of what could be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That everything I learned about linked data at Porism could be useful during my time at GDS. That was quite a surprise. Darren was throwing out technical terms left, right and centre – and I understood everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compose myself during meetings. I get very excited about things and that’s not always good, especially if your body language communicates a commitment to a project prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reading&quot;&gt;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>The Staying of the Course</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We’re reaching the mid-point of the quarter, so there’s a flurry of things going on. The team is chugging through work at a good pace, but there’s still so much to do if we’re to achieve the objective for our mission. Opening up conversation on how we’ll meet those goals has been good, but we’re subject to so many external factors it can sometimes be tough to stay the course. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@stevenjmesser/dealing-with-domineering-clients-67052f02f551&quot;&gt;Sailing analogies&lt;/a&gt; are quite good for framing team-work and missions, I find.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;five-things-that-happened&quot;&gt;Five Things That Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We did more things than this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;one&quot;&gt;One&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having migrated the first two applications over to a new hosting provider, we had a v-team retrospective with our friends in Reliability Engineering. It worked well, acting as a review of the steps we’d previously taken, giving us the chance to improve the run book for next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one gotcha to eliminate for next time: making sure that the release pipeline is clear and no one’s forgotten to release Puppet changes specifically. Our lead architect, Tim, reminded everyone that it was their responsibility to own a pull request (and associated changes) all the way through and to keep the deployment pipeline as clear as possible. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/standards/continuous-delivery.html#use-continuous-delivery&quot;&gt;Continuous delivery&lt;/a&gt; relies on principles rather than process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had our first GOV.UK product manager fortnightly meet-up with the new Head of Product, Leanne. It was a bit full-on for her first session, but then again it was probably a perfect introduction for someone who’s going to own our high-level strategy for the forseeable future. We touched briefly on the product triage process – which has dominated most fortnightly meetings in recent months – and it was relatively trivial as opposed to the usual furore. That was good to see. Chatter about it had been dividing us as a community of late, but we were unified on it this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rob used the &lt;a href=&quot;http://leancoffee.org&quot;&gt;Lean Coffee&lt;/a&gt; approach to decide what we’d talk about next. Everyone wanted to talk overwhelmingly about the roadmap and the next 12 months – which, unfortunately, we’re not able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.productplan.com/p/bUmH4fHC0hOivX-E2LYMu2hg9uEhkWp_&quot;&gt;make public like in previous years&lt;/a&gt;. I’m not entirely certain on the reasons behind that but I don’t think it was an internal decision, because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/developing-a-roadmap&quot;&gt;using roadmaps as an open communication tool is a principle we hold dear&lt;/a&gt;. I suspect it could be more to do with our roadmap being seen as a delivery plan rather than &lt;a href=&quot;https://svpg.com/vision-vs-strategy/&quot;&gt;a strategy to achieving a multipart vision&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view, GOV.UK has pretty much (but not totally) achieved its &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee204/ProductMarketFit.html&quot;&gt;product–market fit&lt;/a&gt; and should now be concerned with scaling. The issue we have is that new and existing departments on GOV.UK often bring solutionised features to us as problems, and many expect their requests to be built out. We have a good set of products and features to offer to government but I’m not sure where the sales process happens, and we need an amount of feedback from those interactions to influence our product iterations. In the meantime there’s plenty of work to be done on scaling the platform’s architecture and that’s something we can do with application- and machine-level data alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Three&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it meant I missed a team lunch for a new starter on Platform Health, we took one and half hours out of a busy day to map the problem space of publishing, and it was really beneficial. Myself, Humin, Sam and Mark, all product managers on publishing aspects of the platform, wrote up the high level problems we see with scaling GOV.UK and grouped those by theme. It’s intended to form a strategy for solving those problems, but in a time when reliability is perhaps more important than efficiency, I’m not sure how much of it we’ll be able to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That aside, it was excellent to get together with PMs from across the programme and join up our thinking. I’ve been meaning to do that ever since joining Platform Health, bringing other product teams and their goals into our team’s thinking. Because, arguably, I am currently a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/productschool/what-is-technical-product-management-anyway-d36deb3216d0&quot;&gt;technical product manager&lt;/a&gt; whether I intended to become one or not. And technical product management has internal teams as its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’ve got a couple of product ideas bobbing around and have a hankering to scratch the ‘build a thing’ itch, so if you want to get involved in a side hustle, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:stevenjmesser@gmail.com&quot;&gt;hit me up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;four&quot;&gt;Four&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent two hours coming up with options to upgrade and manage our Elasticsearch with Bevan. If I’m honest, I wasn’t really sure how to approach this, but I knew we needed a range of options plus their technical, financial and product-focussed impacts to present to the programme team for them to choose from. Sort of like a Choose Your Own Adventure business case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5772/1*49VaAAfIY-cEY5d6THUG8Q.png&quot; alt=&quot;A matrix of options plotted against risks, benefits, technical complexity, delivery time and financial costs&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;A matrix of options plotted against risks, benefits, technical complexity, delivery time and financial costs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I freestyled a matrix of Post-it notes, detailing the different stages and options plotted against the risks, benefits, technical complexity, delivery time and financial costs of each. It actually worked quite well and we got all the brainstorming done inside of the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a point was raised, there would usually be a counterpoint to consider for a different option, meaning we grew a body of thoughts quite quickly. Much better than scrolling up and down a document, scribbling in part-thoughts and half-formed sentences, which I’ve done previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;five&quot;&gt;Five&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bevan covered how we code and quality assure products and features at GOV.UK. This was off the back of our retrospective, where Alan had asked to be introduced to our process and I was keen to hear about it too. We’d been told about it informally but found this proper session really useful. And it was good to understand the inner workings as compared to the development process at previous places I’ve worked. It’s pretty fast at GOV.UK and everything’s to such a high quality, I was just really intrigued to know more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hangs off a set of principles rather than defined processes. I’m paraphrasing here, but essentially our developers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;are responsible for their code and features throughout the development and release lifecycle,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;should test their code and its dependencies,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;have code peer-reviewed for quality,&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;should QA their code in integration, either individually or with product managers, and&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;use continuous delivery to release small, frequent changes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital&quot;&gt;GDS Way&lt;/a&gt; but bear in mind that this works for us and may not suit other teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-learned&quot;&gt;What I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That all these facilitation techniques and Post-it noting practices are just methods for getting ideas out. Yes, I was skeptical at first and I know many people still are, but they work. If you’re struggling to have productive conversations at work and meetings go round in circles, try something different. There’s shitloads of blogs and other websites with loads of approaches you can try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-could-do-better&quot;&gt;What I Could Do Better&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask people to give feedback to my line manager. A colleague came over and praised me for some work, saying they’d pass it on, but I’ve neglected to ask people to do that in the past. I’m going to make sure I know who line manages each person on our team, too, so I can furnish them with all the good work our people do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reading&quot;&gt;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/f8e9c2ea-b29b-11e8-87e0-d84e0d934341&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governments fail to capitalise on swaths of open data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
