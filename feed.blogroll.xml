        <title>Blogging and working in the open</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a talk I gave to the GDS product management community a year ago. It’s mostly aimed at other people working in digital transformation of government, but actually I think everyone should blog a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s lots of ways of working in the open, blogging is just one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-is-the-point-of-blogging&quot;&gt;So what is the point of blogging?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we should define what a blog is. The noun ‘blog’ means a regularly updated website or web page, typically one run by an individual or small group, that is written in an informal or conversational style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogs have been a part of the Web since the 1990s when web publishing tools were made easier-to-use for non-technical folk. They’ve always tended to be in a diary style, allowing people to talk about what they do, their interests and anything they please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-whats-the-point-of-blogging-in-government&quot;&gt;But what’s the point of blogging in government?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging helps to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open up government&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;form a dialogue with our audience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;share what we’ve learnt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really all about starting conversations and sharing knowledge. The audience might be fellow service creators or it might be end users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s worthwhile taking this a step further. Blogging is all about working in the open. Working in the open causes you to be honest about your work and makes it easier to collaborate with smart communities of peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll expand on that…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-the-point-of-being-open&quot;&gt;What’s the point of being open?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-transformation-strategy-2017-to-2020/government-transformation-strategy-tools-processes-and-governance&quot;&gt;Government Transformation Strategy&lt;/a&gt; says that ‘a culture of open, digitally enabled policy making and service delivery is critical to our future success.’ It’s written into our values as an organisation too: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#make-things-open-it-makes-things-better&quot;&gt;‘Make things open, it makes things better.’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being open is about the importance of working across organisational boundaries to make things better for users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone in Department A talks about a particular problem and someone in Department B says they’ve encountered the same thing, they’re likely to ignore the boundaries and differences between their departments and explore the problem together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shared goal is making things better for users and working in the open helps facilitate that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, more formally, what are the goals of openness?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And these don’t just cover blogging, they can be attributed to our day-to-day practice too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-goals-of-openness&quot;&gt;The goals of openness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These come from &lt;a href=&quot;https://openmatt.org/2011/04/06/how-to-work-open/&quot;&gt;Open Matt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog-participation.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participation&lt;/strong&gt;: it’s rocket-fuel for smart collaboration. Speaking outside of your organisational box can attract other people, get conversations started and accelerate collaboration. (Joined-up working, yeah?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog-agility.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agility&lt;/strong&gt;: speed, flexibility, getting shit done. When you work in the open, you’re more likely to check what you’re saying before putting it out there. It encourages a better, more accountable working practice, as well as working out how to build the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog-momentum.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Momentum&lt;/strong&gt;: communities want to push boulders that are already moving. Simply put, working in the open is cheap PR. People love to get involved in exciting projects headed in the right direction. One of my favourite stories is how Neil Williams got offered a job at GDS because he blogged so enthusiastically about a single government website, and Tom Loosemore happened to spot it. But you see this with the Local Digital Coalition too. Teams in previously under-the-radar councils becoming visibly active in improving their authority’s ways of working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog-testing.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing and rapid prototyping&lt;/strong&gt;: refining as we go. Working in the open creates better feedback and testing loops, and the history of changes is documented. You have the opportunity to welcome a more diverse set of voices to comment on your work, which is always a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog-leverage.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage&lt;/strong&gt;: getting greater bang from our limited resources. And again, blogging is really cheap PR. I’ve personally made a ton of good connections I didn’t expect simply by talking about what I’ve done. Don’t worry about making things too polished though, raw honesty (or slightly processed honesty – runny honey) is some of the secret sauce to making it work. (That means you can talk about failure as well as success.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-why-blog-about-our-work&quot;&gt;So why blog about our work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogging is not about thought leadership or public performance, it’s about actively feeding the conversation around agile, user-centred transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By putting our experiences out there and talking about the new challenges we’re facing, people can empathise or respond, developing the transformation project we’re all a part of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we should be more open to talking about failure too, or announcing when things didn’t go to plan. Not to call ourselves out but help others later down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dxw.com/2019/02/discovery-embracing-the-unknowns/&quot;&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt; from Ellie Craven who used to be the PM on GOV.UK Registers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘The more we obscure how we work, and why it’s valuable, the harder we’ll find it to gain broad organisational support for the next project, and the one after that.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking about our work helps us better describe it and its value across government. It also gives you a chance to show your working without that person needing to attend a talk or Show &amp;amp; Tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then she goes one better…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘We should do the hard work to &lt;strong&gt;make this simpler for those who come after us&lt;/strong&gt;.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s my emphasis, but talking about our work &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; helps people who might one day step into our shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So going back to what I said before, blogging helps to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;open up government&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;form a dialogue with our audience&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;share what we’ve learnt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-principles&quot;&gt;Some principles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some principles (for civil servants) then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code&quot;&gt;Civil Service Code&lt;/a&gt; underpins everything. Stick by that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the first real rule, &lt;strong&gt;don’t be a dick&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try not to be the person to say the wrong thing or inadvertently give away a ministerial plan or cause offence to a team member. None of that is good, but you can mitigate it by asking a second pair of eyes to look over your work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask someone before mentioning them&lt;/strong&gt;, they might be staying away from the ‘spotlight’. One of my colleagues doesn’t use social media, for example, and wants to stay away from it, so I only ever referred to them as ‘our delivery manager’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers suck&lt;/strong&gt;, so avoid telling another team’s story. They might be doing great things but try not to build too much of a picture if you must mention it. They should have the right to cause a splash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-i-start-blogging&quot;&gt;How can I start blogging?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that’s done enough to convince you to get started. So here’s a few tips to get going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog-kanban.png&quot; alt=&quot;A 'Blog' column on a kanban board&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a ‘Blog’ column to your kanban board. It’ll help you consider which pieces of work are worth sharing and talking about. You might even build up a few stories per sprint to talk about. Break it down into smaller chunks, it’s much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to start small and maybe try something more personal, &lt;a href=&quot;https://productforthepeople.xyz/the-why-of-weeknotes-c1cd98967842&quot;&gt;weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; are a great way to get going. Weeknotes are personal reflections on your working week to learn from what you’ve done and improve your practice from week to week. You simply write about what you’ve done and how you feel about how it went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s an excellent community on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23weeknotes&quot;&gt;#weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; hashtag on Twitter who can give you ideas, but you can also just ask for help. They’re super friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth saying that blogging isn’t an easy thing to start, you’ll probably get ‘the fear’ about receiving criticism on your work or thoughts. But that’s fine, my advice is to just dive in and have a go. Usually your fears don’t match reality, and there’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es&quot;&gt;an amazing community&lt;/a&gt; there to comment and help if you’re struggling anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need any money to get started, really, you can spin up a blog in minutes using platforms like &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a quick way to test out the practice and see if it’s right for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to create your own website, static site generators like &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gohugo.io&quot;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; are low-tech ways to get started. You might have heard of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; which runs on Jekyll. You simply feed it some Markdown files and it builds a website for you. GitHub Pages is free too, and it’s a good way to become more familiar with Git in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you needn’t worry about having to promote your blog posts either. Services like &lt;a href=&quot;https://lttr.ai/Mg8L&quot;&gt;Missinglettr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com&quot;&gt;Zapier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://quuu.co/promote&quot;&gt;Quuu Promote&lt;/a&gt; will syndicate your blog posts on social media automatically, helping your posts to get a greater reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/self-facilitating-media-node.gif&quot; alt=&quot;A scene from Nathan Barley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may become a self-facilitating media node. That’s fine. The goal is to share knowledge and passion and get more people involved in agile, user-centred transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-note-on-passion&quot;&gt;A note on passion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the talk, I asked members of the audience to raise their hand if they wanted to work at GDS after reading one of its blog posts. 75 per cent of people put their hand up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reading List Picks of 2019</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s a bunch of articles and blog posts that got me thinking about digital government, product management, design thinking, the World Wide Web and data this year. There’s also a couple of nice stories I enjoyed thrown in. Oh, and some stuff about attention too, because this list is full of useful distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve not included anything about privacy, which I should have, but I think that probably deserves its own post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;digital-government&quot;&gt;Digital government&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;just-enough-internet-why-public-service-internet-should-be-a-model-of-restraint&quot;&gt;Just enough Internet: Why public service Internet should be a model of restraint&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heavyweight thinking on good, responsible technology in public service from Rachel Coldicutt, which has been this year’s hot topic alongside privacy. Rachel’s piece does well to bring together thinking from across the public service space, including sessions from MozFest 2018, viewing it through a lens of sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.doteveryone.org.uk/2019/10/just-enough-internet/&quot;&gt;Just enough Internet: Why public service Internet should be a model of restraint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;there-is-no-such-thing-as-the-government&quot;&gt;There is no such thing as the government&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was posted in 2010, around the time &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/directgov-2010-and-beyond-revolution-not-evolution-a-report-by-martha-lane-fox&quot;&gt;Martha Lane Fox’s report on Directgov&lt;/a&gt; was published, leading to the creation of Government Digital Service and GOV.UK. In it Stefan Czerniawski talks about how the dream for joined-up government services has been around for years, and it’s a key historical text for anyone working in the current era of transformation&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. (There’s bonus archived blog posts from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tomskitomski&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/neillyneil&quot;&gt;Neil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jukesie&quot;&gt;Jukesie&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.publicstrategist.com/2010/11/there-is-no-such-thing-as-the-government/&quot;&gt;There is no such thing as the government&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-problem-with-the-service-lifecycle&quot;&gt;The problem with the service lifecycle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service design lifecycle in government has four stages: discovery, alpha, beta, live. It’s an agile technique from the world of software development, and its aim is to help teams and organisations create new things while reducing waste. But it’s a linear strategy with a resolute end, it doesn’t set you up for what’s next. Sanjay put forward the idea of the lifecycle as a spiral, which I really like as it helps you think about step-changes. You might have digitised a bunch of paper forms, but how might you discover the bigger problem to solve?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@sanjaypoyzer/the-problem-with-the-service-lifecycle-5efe278f5119&quot;&gt;The problem with the service lifecycle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-sharing-in-government-why-its-time-for-a-new-approach&quot;&gt;Data-sharing in government: why it’s time for a new approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If bits of government start using more data to design and deliver things, what will people think about government and will they trust it? This is one of many pieces Richard has written in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3066631/software-is-politics&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;software is politics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; genre, but it’s a good one for considering how the social contract plays into trust models and data re-use. Essentially: there should be clear lines of accountability and responsibility for citizens to have recourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;product-management--design-thinking&quot;&gt;Product management &amp;amp; design thinking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;right-question-wrong-answer-agile-stakeholder-management&quot;&gt;Right question, wrong answer: agile stakeholder management&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most product teams will know about HiPPOs – the highest paid person in the organisation – and their opinions. Sometimes senior people will ask why a team hasn’t produced a particular output, and Matt puts forward a helpful mindset for breaking that down. It’s easy to get dismayed or irked in those situations but this piece sets a principled approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resources-for-applying-a-systems-lens-to-your-work&quot;&gt;Resources for applying a systems lens to your work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time looking at the bigger picture in work this year and came across this post in the summer. It has a a bunch of great resources for how to address root causes, not symptoms of problems – systems-thinking. Even reading the first book on the list, Dan Hill’s &lt;em&gt;Dark Matter and Trojan Horses&lt;/em&gt;, changed the way I work. Make your way through the list, it’s great. Shout-out to Aly (and Will, of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-social-contract&quot;&gt;A New Social Contract&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first post in a four-part series on redesigning democracy from Alastair Parvin. He’s done incredibly well to set the problems and proposed solutions within their context, making it all relatable. An expert use of storytelling and systems-thinking to propose new futures, with a nod to &lt;a href=&quot;https://public.digital/2018/09/25/making-government-as-a-platform-real/&quot;&gt;government as a platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-you-should-stop-using-product-roadmaps-and-try-gist-planning&quot;&gt;Why you should stop using product roadmaps and try GIST planning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decent framework from Itamar Gilad that wraps in Lean Startup methods, OKRs, and a pipeline for testing ideas, all sat beneath the organisation’s shared goals and strategy. I tried it out on the Search team and we made some good progress. A good way to avoid the agile build trap, do more prototyping, and empower product teams to deliver outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-read-about-design-for-trust-so-you-dont-have-to&quot;&gt;I Read About “Design For Trust” So You Don’t Have To&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does what it says on the tin. A compendium of links to and a summary of many ‘design for trust’ posts from across the Web. (It’s worth reading all the content the author draws on though!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-machine-stops&quot;&gt;The Machine Stops&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either peak smartphone isn’t far off or we’ve reached it already. The late neurologist Oliver Sacks writes about the disappearence of old civilities, where people have replaced talking to their neighbours with talking to their phones. But there’s hope in this piece too, that people will realise the need to sustain the richness of human cultures. And since more of us are putting our phones down, I’m hopeful too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-attention-economy&quot;&gt;The attention economy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owen Williams puts forward the idea that most products are competing for the space in front of your eyeballs. Attention is now a commodity as much as technology, and the only limit is the population and the number of waking hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Niksen&lt;/em&gt; is the Dutch concept of embracing boredom to stop ourselves being so busy. It’s a bit like mindfulness, only you don’t need to pay Headspace a subscription fee to learn how to do it. This piece makes the case for doing nothing with purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-internets-back-to-the-land-movement&quot;&gt;The Internet’s Back-to-the-Land Movement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following on from the piece by &lt;em&gt;Lowtech&lt;/em&gt; magazine in &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/12/23/reading-list-picks-of-2018/&quot;&gt;last year’s picks&lt;/a&gt;, this piece by Becca Abbe talks about moving off-grid in a digital sense: opting out of mainstream internet providers and building independent mesh networks or a peer-to-peer Web. Whatever the solution, making things more sustainable is a critical consideration for the next few decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rise-and-demise-of-rss&quot;&gt;The Rise and Demise of RSS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RSS is one of those wonderful Web technologies, meaning you can follow updates from anyone across the world. In simple terms, it’s a bit like tweets without Twitter. But depsite getting off to a good start, RSS has all but disappeared as people have moved to centralised silos like Twitter. The reason? Too many competing standards. The story of RSS teaches us that a better, more open Web will come from getting better at working together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein to the story of RSS, Ruben Verborgh talks about the last two decades of research into the Semantic Web – and how it hasn’t really changed the world much. The dream was big, the vision was crystal clear, but through lack of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food&quot;&gt;dogfooding&lt;/a&gt; the dream hasn’t been delivered. But if semantic technologies can be brough out of the research space and into the world of product development…who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-as-institutional-memory&quot;&gt;Data as institutional memory&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another excellent post about standards, from Adam, plumping for collaboratively developed standards as part of a system, not just a by-product of policy and legislation. ‘Fix the plumbing by identifying the leaks’ rang in my head for a couple of days after reading this, it’s a great analogy. Great stuff on designing data as infrastructure in the 21st century. (Adam running his mouth in the pub is something I enjoy being around, it produces gems like this.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-data-is-never-raw&quot;&gt;Why Data Is Never Raw&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t believe we should aim for data-driven futures because it renders human decisions as useless. Instead we should be data-informed, reading metrics and measures to inform our decisions. But it’s worth remembering that data is never raw: the schema by which you collect and read data goes some way to defining how you’ll interpret it. In &lt;em&gt;The New Atlantis&lt;/em&gt;, Nick Barrowman talks about the seductive myth of information free of human judgment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world of structured data was a right headf**k when I first joined Porism. Since there’s much chatter about ontologies, taxonomies, registers and other aspects of semantic technologies at work now, I always send this article to anyone starting out. Who knew a story about Marco Polo would help frame it so well?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of how BBC iPlayer came about because of a drunken brainstorm as told by Tony Ageh, who was the project director for the thing. It’s funny and uplifting and wonderfully down-to-earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Gibson invented the word ‘cyberspace’ and, along with it, the cyberpunk movement and everything that inspired. I grew up on &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Johnny Mnemonic&lt;/em&gt; and the video game &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex&lt;/em&gt;, so it’s pleasing to hear how the books that inspired those worlds – beginning with Gibson’s debut &lt;em&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/em&gt; – came together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By talking to teenagers about the acid house movement of the 1980s, Jeremy Deller managed to explore the period and what it was really all about, without falling on the obvious answer of drugs. This is a good interview about his documentary, &lt;em&gt;Everybody in the Place: an Incomplete History of Britain 1984–92&lt;/em&gt;, but you should definitely also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000777d&quot;&gt;watch the doc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Revivalist aesthetic: musical discoveries from 2019</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year I put together &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/user/renegatus/playlist/7kFVj9Y23ABBFZKpho2kTb?si=TRb7A_7tS26LV8yLESGqjg&quot;&gt;a playlist of music I’d loved or first listened to in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and, genre-wise, it was relatively varied. Beats, jazz-funk, rock, club heaters, hip-hop and some essential bass music. This year’s list, however, is quite different to that. It’s a playlist of songs that are mostly all the same, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019 has been the year of the revivalist sound, with young producers harkening back to the days of 1990s rave with pumping modern tributes. The stand-out release for me has been Soundbwoy Killah’s &lt;em&gt;Halcyon Daze&lt;/em&gt;, an LP ‘suffused…with the heady fug of rave memories and long nights in the dance’ (&lt;a href=&quot;https://bleep.com/release/140146-soundbwoy-killah-halcyon-daze&quot;&gt;as told by Bleep&lt;/a&gt;). They’re tunes that make you want to go raving again, even if your own halcyon days were 2006–2013, not the decade previous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This playlist is packed with those kinds of tunes, it reeks of nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way, it’s a mournful playlist. Going out these days isn’t like what it used to be (*cough* old man *cough*). In reviving the warehouse rave, clubs like Printworks have mass-marketed and stripped away the original appeal: underground folklore. It’s something Burial touches on in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thewire.co.uk/in-writing/interviews/burial_unedited-transcript&quot;&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Wire&lt;/em&gt; magazine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The UK was changing in a different direction, away from us. Maybe the feeling of the UK in clubs and stuff back then, it wasn’t as artificial, self-aware or created by the internet. It was more rumour, underground folklore. No mobile phones back then. Anyone could go into the night and they had to seek it out. Because you could see it in people, you could see it in their eyes. Those ravers were at the edge at their lives, they weren’t running ahead or falling behind, they were just right there and the tunes meant everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a time when I respected music in that way. These days I don’t give it enough dedication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then again, maybe it’s an optimistic playlist. The music I’ve listened to and loved in 2019 seems to be sounds of a remembered era, and I’m really keen to go out and hear music again. I miss it: the swaying, the lights, the sweat, the laughs. So 41 tracks remembering all that has sparked my keenness to get dancing again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that’s enough blabbering. Here’s the playlist of tracks I discovered or loved in 2019. Listen on &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/user/renegatus/playlist/38zfJWixkV78IKP7glwFyK?si=xmdXYJcsT4qo-3CiVwusBQ&quot;&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://buymusic.club/list/and-more-discoveries-2019&quot;&gt;Bandcamp through Buy Music Club&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here’s to getting back out there. See you in the dance, front-left.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jam London 2019</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past few years I’ve been going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jamlondon.io/events/&quot;&gt;Jam London&lt;/a&gt;, a product and design conference sharing the stories behind great products. It’s great to hear from product and design leaders from across the world, and I’ve always learned a thing or two that I take back to my practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some rough notes I made on my phone during the talks, in case it’s helpful for others. The full line-up is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jamlondon.io/events/jam-london-2019&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The talks from Jamie Nicholson, Chelsea Bullock and Susana Lopes were best for me that day. Lots about navigating uncertainty, trust, empathy and failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-with-stories&quot;&gt;Building with Stories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;jeff-gardner-intercom&quot;&gt;Jeff Gardner, Intercom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories the best way to organise people around a single idea. But why do we think we’re not capable of building stories? Here’s some tips on building better stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The type of story we’re telling is a business parable, driving someone’s behaviour to reach an outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good stories must have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a clear message&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;emotionally engaging&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;simple enough to be retold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A story is an idea virus, and good stories are contagious. It can be easy to make a story short, quicker to tell, retell and understand. Make stories short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focus on feelings, rather than details. How do you want the audience to feel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adapt to your audience. Comedians spend lots of time seeing jokes bomb to understand which will work. You need to try to be good. Saying ‘Anyway, it’s a long story’ can help you understand whether anyone wants to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make storytelling a practice, learn from what doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start with the point&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set the scene, quickly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use dialogue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Surprise!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restate the point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all the animals, we’re the only ones that live in a dual reality: the world in front of us and the world in our heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-trust-with-research-teams&quot;&gt;Building trust with research teams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;chelsea-bullock-mailchimp&quot;&gt;Chelsea Bullock, Mailchimp&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team dynamics are different when teams have trust between the members. New teams have lower trust; teams with trust move fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worked on a project based on a VP’s idea with a team that had high trust. Tried to reframe the feature proposal but kept running into dead ends, it wasn’t going to work. They were asked how to do it, not whether to do it or not. Users didn’t fundamentally see the problem so the feature didn’t need it. High trust team only spiralled for a while and they quickly pivoted to saying ‘This won’t work’ and the company was grateful, saved money and time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mutual trust meant they could move from discovery to validation to learning very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you know if you’re working in a trust vacuum?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No one knows what you’re doing there&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deliverables feel safer than learnings&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doubts and suspicions about motivations and goals of team-mates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust gap can cause problems. Build empathy and trust to move forward together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stage Zero collaboration: or, where to start when you don’t know how to begin. First step in building trust between research partners is asking ‘What decision will these findings enable you to make?’ Gives you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clarity of mission&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;buy-in on the stakes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;alignment in prioritisation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successfully answering that requires&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;curiosity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;vulnerability &amp;amp; compassion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;clear vision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stories clarify our expectations of each other and acknowledge the value we all bring to the work. It energises teams and renews trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really easy to keep our heads down and deliver, but we should turn these into collective stories. Show &amp;amp; tell often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust over tools. Tools and frameworks are easy, but understanding and communication is most useful. Empathy.
￼
Trust is better for team health. If there’s low trust, establish clarity of mission and get leadership involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/IMG_1836.png&quot; alt=&quot;Building trust with your research team&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-research-inspires-new-products&quot;&gt;How research inspires new products&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;jamie-nicholson-instagram&quot;&gt;Jamie Nicholson, Instagram&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design for and with people. Understand needs, desires and wants. Do research early, not after building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing ideas and getting feedback is very important, but it’s easy to get lost and not move the needle (meet business objectives). What’s the problem you’re solving? How is that part of people’s lives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moved from ‘Why do you use Instagram?’ to ‘How do you make friends?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looked at how the different features fit into making friendships. You might like an acquaintance’s photo, but you’ll send a DM to a best friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask big questions. (How do they want to feel? Uncover behaviours and mental models, to see how this things sits in someone’s life.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get beneath the surface of what is said, people don’t know what they want. Go deep to find the magic they need.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk to extremes. Start at the edges and move inwards. Don’t go for average behaviours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personas are hard, you can’t design for the average with millions of users. Instead tell the stories of people you find that represent a broader group of people. It drives empathy in the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;agile-for-everybody-everybody-hates-agile&quot;&gt;Agile for Everybody, Everybody Hates Agile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;matt-lemay-sudden-compass&quot;&gt;Matt LeMay, Sudden Compass&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile is a completely made-up thing that 17 people dreamed up on a ski weekend, so &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agile methods ask people to think and, frankly, that’s a hard sell. So be brave, get started and change the way you’re working until it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-scale-globally&quot;&gt;How to scale globally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;kaarel-kuddu-transferwise&quot;&gt;Kaarel Kuddu, Transferwise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launched in a country based on World Bank data. Didn’t work because they didn’t know their customers and how TransferWise fit into their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ran an experiment to see if people would choose currencies to send. Got some data, saw demand for currencies, launched those and tracked uptake. No correlation between demand and uptake because product experience wasn’t approached in the same way in different countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;failure&quot;&gt;Failure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;maryam-mazraei-autopsy&quot;&gt;Maryam Mazraei, Autopsy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 years of work ended in failure, which got her interested in taking lessons from failure. Survivor bias creates problems for people who follow the ‘playbook’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the common components of failure help you to spot patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data from Crunchbase, OpenCorporates, Companies House, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keep-pace-master-product-at-bmw-100-years-old&quot;&gt;Keep pace, master product at BMW (100 years old)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;sabrina-rzepka-bmw&quot;&gt;Sabrina Rzepka, BMW&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with cars different: no feature flags, no Build-Measure-Learn, no fail fast. Features have many dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make a vision visible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gain speed with a co-pilot&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on the essentials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-didnt-fail-your-product-did&quot;&gt;You didn’t fail, your product did&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;susana-lopes-onfido&quot;&gt;Susana Lopes, Onfido&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind pristine LinkedIn profiles are our bruised egos and failed projects. They’re lurking there and we never talk about our shadow careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grew up with the ‘Failure is not an option’ mantra but it turned her into a dictator. Worked at Huddle, they had quarterly commitments for sales people, things they’d deliver on time that didn’t exist yet. Made her think that success = shipping on time. Efficiency theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By thinking that failure was not an option, she chose the easiest route to success - instead of actually delivering value to customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear of failure creates high pressure and clouded judgement. You need to release that pressure to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swapped ‘Failure is not an option’ for ‘Fail fast, fail early’, de-risking aspects of the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spoke to customers using web product on Android to collect problems, hoping to rebuild the Android app and convert those people. De-risked problem and value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De-risked usability. De-risked feasibility. Kept shipping and growing, de-risking beforehand…until the numbers stalled. Value plateaued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didn’t validate that the problem existed for enough people, enough of the time. But blamed herself. Emotional resilience held her back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she didn’t fail, the product did. And she learned and can do better next time. Separate self-worth from product-worth, maybe by creating product success metrics and personal success metrics. Creates emotional distance by being product’s worst critic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/IMG_1838.png&quot; alt=&quot;Failing forward&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reading List Picks of 2018</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a heck of a year. I got to fulfill a teenage dream and start working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk&quot;&gt;an important and much-used website&lt;/a&gt;, which got me thinking about product management, people, work and the World Wide Web more than  I did last year. Here’s a bunch of articles and blog posts that piqued my interest throughout 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-build-a-low-tech-website&quot;&gt;How to Build a Low-tech Website?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low-tech Magazine looks at the sustainability of the modern world and its practices. They decided to practice what they preach by making their website run entirely on solar power, using web design techniques to reduce energy consumption and a self-built solar power bank to run it all – no data centres and CDNs in sight. Though it occasionally goes offline when there’s not enough power, the article really got me thinking about the ‘always on’ nature of the Web and how that’s quite wasteful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website.html&quot;&gt;How to Build a Low-tech Website?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-bullshit-web&quot;&gt;The Bullshit Web&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein to Low-tech Magazine, Nick Heer wrote about the ballooning bullshit of data on the Web and the wastefulness of filling your 17MB/s internet connection with ads. It’s an essay on what the Web was meant to be, and what it has become; and how the Information Superhighway could benefit from those of us working on it to take more responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://pxlnv.com/blog/bullshit-web/&quot;&gt;The Bullshit Web&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-cognition-crisis&quot;&gt;The Cognition Crisis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waking up and checking your phone. Scrolling through Facebook while the telly’s on. Notifications causing drivers to kill people. Adam Gazzaley argues that ‘our constant engagement with technology interferes with the pursuit of other behaviors critical for maintaining a healthy mind’, and it caused me to turn on Do Not Disturb when at work. We have natural animal minds that are being pushed to the edge by the environment we’ve built around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/s/futurehuman/the-cognition-crisis-a1482e889fcb&quot;&gt;The Cognition Crisis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-principles-that-make-me-a-better-product-manager&quot;&gt;The principles that make me a better product manager&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing that’s central to the practice of product management, it’s a set of principles one can call on in any situation. A good principle can keep everyone on course but also help point the way forward in unfamiliar waters. Ross Ferguson left us with seven principles before he was poached by the Canadians, and they’ve really helped me in my first year at Government Digital Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@rossferg/the-principles-that-make-me-a-better-product-manager-9e50814d184f&quot;&gt;The principles that make me a better product manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thinking-about-slos&quot;&gt;Thinking about SLOs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working out how to maintain and operate a behemoth like GOV.UK was pretty daunting when I joined Platform Health. Adopting a Service Level Objective and thinking about how we manage technical solutions from a users-first perspective has been massively helpful. I’m really grateful that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emilylabram&quot;&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt; posted this by Andrew Suffield – one-time Site Reliability Engineer at Google – and for all her work on spreading SLO thinking at GDS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;teams-from-scratch--part-1-psychological-safety&quot;&gt;Teams from Scratch – Part 1: Psychological Safety&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a culture where asking questions and admitting gaps in knowledge is OK can be hard, but this piece popped up serendipitously around the time I was doing a lot of thinking on team-building. It turned out that Alex worked at Unruly, an adtech company which shares our office building, and we’ve been meeting for coffee ever since!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@probablyfine/teams-from-scratch-part-1-psychological-safety-ea43d46cdbc6&quot;&gt;Teams from Scratch – Part 1: Psychological Safety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-did-privacy-come-to-be-enshrined-as-a-human-right&quot;&gt;How did privacy come to be enshrined as a human right?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this year of our Lord, 2018, when the General Data Protection Regulation was enshrined in law, no doubt many of us were thinking &lt;em&gt;Why on earth are we going through all this pain?&lt;/em&gt; Preparing for GDPR was a huge undertaking, and despite the boring spreadsheets and confusing issues around compliance, I think it’s largely a Good Thing. This series by Projects by IF traces the history of our right to privacy and the role of regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/if-policy-research/how-did-privacy-come-to-be-enshrined-as-a-human-right-286d97344008&quot;&gt;How did privacy come to be enshrined as a human right?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;microdosing-isnt-a-shortcut-to-professional-success&quot;&gt;Microdosing Isn’t a Shortcut to Professional Success&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being employed in Tech, with working weeks called ‘sprints’, can often feel like you’re &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; running a race, and open plan offices can dwindle your focus. Some people turn to microdosing – taking small amounts of psychoactive drugs – to find a balance, but Erica Avey argues that perhaps we should change the way we work, not our biology. This article applies to coffee as much as it does to LSD, in my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/s/story/microdosing-lsd-made-me-quit-my-job-ba425aa86fcb&quot;&gt;Microdosing Isn’t a Shortcut to Professional Success&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;weeknotes-styles&quot;&gt;Weeknotes styles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I started writing weeknotes, a weekly reflection on my working week, and I’ve found the practice really beneficial. It’s like a personal retrospective, giving you a chance to package up the week and move on, making improvements. I recommend it to a lot of people I meet, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stamanfar&quot;&gt;Sam&lt;/a&gt; wrote this piece on the different styles the &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es&quot;&gt;Web of Weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; community uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/weeknote-styles-61d957e58a4a&quot;&gt;Weeknotes styles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;this-isnt-for-everyone&quot;&gt;This isn’t for everyone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What surprised me most when I joined GDS was that many of our products didn’t have defined user personas. Nor did we say who we wouldn’t build things for. Not all users are equal. The mindset of building for everyone is helpful in not excluding certain groups, but it can widen the scope of a product too much. The Parliament Data team, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fantasticlife&quot;&gt;Michael&lt;/a&gt; in particular, have been good in acknowledging that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;democratic-technical-debt&quot;&gt;Democratic technical debt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital government has surged forth leaving improved services in its wake. But how much of the enhancements are only surface-deep? ‘If you don’t consider what the long term impact of how you build something is, you’re accruing democratic technical debt,’ author Alex Blandford says. While also positing that terrific idea, Alex also points out that, well, government has been a bit shit at providing the research it has conducted. A few blog posts ain’t enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-personal-resilience-or-how-to-avoid-burnout&quot;&gt;Building personal resilience (or how to avoid burnout)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year has been hectic, and it’s possible for work to become all-consuming if you’re not careful. What helped me avoid that was to draw a line between my professional and personal lives: I used weeknotes to package up the week, and I used personal time to replenish my mind and soul. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pippapeasland&quot;&gt;Pippa&lt;/a&gt; takes a great perspective on how to do that in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;targeted-advertising-is-ruining-the-internet-and-breaking-the-world-and-we-should-replace-facebook-with-personal-websites&quot;&gt;Targeted Advertising Is Ruining the Internet and Breaking the World, and We Should Replace Facebook With Personal Websites&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March, I stopped using Facebook to see whether I’d miss it. It wasn’t a problem at all, in fact there’s not a single feature I longed for, so I deleted my account. That’s mostly been driven by their abysmal record for privacy in recent months and their involvement in the Cambridge Analytica atrocity. I’ve read countless articles on Facebook this year, but these two stand out. One shows us how advertising has been a misplaced driver for social media firms, and the other reminds us how the Web worked before the 2.0 giants took over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jukesie&quot;&gt;Matt Jukes&lt;/a&gt; is a legend of the civic tech space, a dynamo of humble magnificence with a Bristol accent – an honest, friendly, earnest kind of bloke. So of course he wrote an open piece on how he works, which caused people from all across the public sector (and others) to write one too. It’s a fascinating to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post covers much of Marty Cagan’s talk when he visited us in September. It’s a long read but it’s absolutely essential for organisations scaling up, past the startup mindset. It reminds us that qualities of leadership can be better than management, and that great teams are full of ordinary people.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This is how I work…give or take</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dasbarrett&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt; wanted to see how I work, so here’s what I do, based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jukesie&quot;&gt;Jukesie’s&lt;/a&gt; rip-off of the Lifehacker ‘How I Work’ series. Other public service folk have written about &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jukesie/this-is-how-we-work-give-or-take-6c8964cac85f&quot;&gt;how they work&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;: London, UK.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Current gig&lt;/strong&gt;: Associate product manager, Government Digital Service.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Current mobile device&lt;/strong&gt;: Samsung J5 for work, iPhone 8 for percy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Current computer&lt;/strong&gt;: MacBook Air 13” for work. Mac Mini at home. Some hobby Raspberry Pis and a PC too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;One word that best describes how you work&lt;/strong&gt;: Metered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-of-all-tell-us-a-little-about-your-background-and-how-you-got-to-where-you-are-today&quot;&gt;First of all, tell us a little about your background and how you got to where you are today&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liked books and computers growing up. Spent a huge portion of my teenage years in my bedroom, tinkering on the Web or with computers. But I also enjoyed writing stories. Aged 16, I decided to focus on my Literature studies instead of Information Technology. It seemed to have…more prestige.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did my A-levels, went to Bath Spa Uni to study Creative Writing. Bought a Mac to stop me playing video games. It worked, and I had a lot of fun. The course was excellent with great teachers – check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/schools/liberal-arts/interest-areas/creative-writing/creative-writing-publications/&quot;&gt;some of the authors who’ve also studied at Bath Spa&lt;/a&gt; – and I had my sights set on a career in publishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graduated. Spent the next year continuing cheffing, then quit to get some work experience and make the most of my degree. Spent two weeks as a managing editorial assistant at Vintage Publishing (part of Random House) and was asked back for another week. A few months later, there’s an open position as an editorial assistant and they ask me to apply. Incredibly, I get it and dive into the literary publishing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do that for 9 months. Move on to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguin.co.uk/company/publishers/vintage/jonathan-cape.html&quot;&gt;Jonathan Cape&lt;/a&gt;, attend a Booker Prize ceremony in my first week. It’s quite glitzy, maybe too glitzy, especially for a working class boy from Wolverhampton. I get the chance to work with some of the most eminent, prolific literary authors in the world. They even let me commission &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/109/1093783/finally-my-ambulance/9780099575870.html&quot;&gt;a book of short stories&lt;/a&gt;. But I feel massively out of my depth and haven’t been to Oxbridge, like most others at my level. Self-doubt sets in. Work is naught but toil. I grow tired of the sausage factory. I quit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I have a breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clouds pass after 6 months and I get a job at NOW TV, which was just starting out. See Agile and software development in action. Turns out that’s quite glitzy too, except I didn’t know that at school. IT is kind of cool now. &lt;em&gt;Hmm, maybe I could do tech after all.&lt;/em&gt; After some time in Operations, they initiate a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/transfers-takeovers&quot;&gt;TUPE process&lt;/a&gt; for an entire department and I need to find other work. &lt;a href=&quot;http://porism.com&quot;&gt;Porism&lt;/a&gt; has an opening for someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I focus on increasing engagement and use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://lginformplus.local.gov.uk&quot;&gt;LG Inform Plus&lt;/a&gt;, then get the chance to redesign and launch a new version of &lt;a href=&quot;https://ecasework.com&quot;&gt;eCasework&lt;/a&gt;. We spent a year on that before it went live. Take-up wasn’t good. I wrestled with marketing techniques, sales, developing some features and trying to talk to the few users we had. Wasn’t really sure what I was doing. It was…enjoyable, but also like banging my head against a brick wall. Repeatedly. Every day. Because I’m leading myself blind. (However, I also learn some cool stuff about open data, local government and generally learn tons from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MikeThacker&quot;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explaining my anguish to a friend, he suggests that I’m kind of doing product management. I read a few blogs, try out the techniques, and they work. &lt;em&gt;Hmm, maybe I could do tech after all.&lt;/em&gt; Attending the product management course at General Assembly gives me new skills. We start to grow eCasework and its user base. We develop features that people love. But I’m a bit hungry for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apply for a job working on GOV.UK. They offer it to me. I’m overjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I’m just really, really happy. I’m at home. I’m back in my bedroom, tinkering on the Web and with computers, on a piece of the national infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;take-us-through-a-recent-workday&quot;&gt;Take us through a recent workday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a T-shaped structure to my week which I try to stick to. Mornings are for product thinking, writing cards or catching up on important emails, except on Wednesdays when I’ll meet &lt;a href=&quot;undefined&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt; for coffee. Then it’s a catch-up with Delivery Manager and Tech Lead, followed by stand-up with the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesdays and Wednesdays, the rest of the day is either meetings, team ceremonies or community meet-ups with other product managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays are a bit lighter: product thinking, analysing data and trends, and chats with other specialists, often dappled with the odd meeting here and there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of what actually happens can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/@stevenjmesser&quot;&gt;my weeknotes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-apps-gadgets-or-tools-cant-you-live-without&quot;&gt;What apps, gadgets or tools can’t you live without?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.com&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; Reminders, my philosopher’s stone at work. With simple commands, I can remind myself or a colleague to do something. Need I say more? Since I have the app on my iPhone too, I can capture those work-related thoughts that spring up in the shower, at dinner or when I’m on holiday. It gets things out of my head, and only brings them back when needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpocket.com&quot;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt; a fair amount to save blogs to read. Medium’s Reading List also comes in handy, but I’m trying to move away from the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, too. It’s the app I use most. To both fill time productively and waste it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mysocialsummary.com&quot;&gt;My Social Summary&lt;/a&gt; is great for catching up on Twitter without needing to scroll through Twitter. It looks for the most engaging tweets from lists you’ve built and sends you a daily digest. Definitely worth £3 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve really taken to Post-it notes as a to-do list. I tried Trello but you’re not always able to add cards in meetings or ceremonies. Post-its are always at hand in GDS, so I can quickly capture sudden thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here’s some &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@stevenjmesser/my-bootstrapped-stack-dca24da282cd&quot;&gt;stuff I’ve used at work&lt;/a&gt; before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-your-best-shortcut-or-life-hack&quot;&gt;What’s your best shortcut or life hack?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have to do something three times, automate it. If you can’t automate it, find a way to reduce the toil. You’ll immediately create more time to spend on things that really need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;take-us-through-an-interesting-unusual-or-finicky-process-you-have-in-place-at-work&quot;&gt;Take us through an interesting, unusual, or finicky process you have in place at work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you forget your work pass, you can’t get through many of the (mostly glass) doors. You end up staring forlornly at the people on the other side, who don’t know whether to let you in &lt;em&gt;sans&lt;/em&gt; ID. Sometimes several people walk past before you’re permitted to exit your dimension of uselessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t worked out how to capitalise on this yet. It’s &lt;em&gt;a bit&lt;/em&gt; like a cigarette break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-you-keep-track-of-what-you-have-to-do&quot;&gt;How do you keep track of what you have to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said earlier, Slack Reminders and Post-it notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-your-favourite-side-project&quot;&gt;What’s your favourite side project?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently playing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; to refresh my &lt;a href=&quot;https://visitmy.website&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and move blog posts away from Medium. But I’m also running out of kimchi so will have to make some more of that soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-you-currently-reading-or-what-do-you-recommend-to-read&quot;&gt;What are you currently reading, or what do you recommend to read?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m reading &lt;em&gt;Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus&lt;/em&gt; by Douglas Rushkoff for non-fiction, and &lt;em&gt;Memoirs of Hadrian&lt;/em&gt; by Marguerite Yourcenar for fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-else-would-you-like-to-see-answer-these-questions&quot;&gt;Who else would you like to see answer these questions?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MikeThacker&quot;&gt;Mike&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Ellayanor&quot;&gt;Ellie&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pr0bablyfine&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johncutlefish&quot;&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/emilylabram&quot;&gt;Emily&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/femkesvs&quot;&gt;Femke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-the-best-advice-youve-ever-received&quot;&gt;What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘You can do whatever you want in life, as long as you don’t hurt anyone.’ Oh, and: ‘Work is just a way to pay the bills, but it helps if you enjoy it.’ Both from my dad.&lt;/p&gt;
