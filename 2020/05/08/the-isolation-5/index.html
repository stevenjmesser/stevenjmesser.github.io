I met the teams and started settling into life as a product manager on the Government-as-a-Platform (GaaP) programme. Already I can see how much Iâ€™m going to enjoy it! Everyoneâ€™s really skilled and passionate about the product, which makes it easier, and theyâ€™ve put considerable effort into making everything understandable.</p><p>At first, I thought it would be tough engaging with the new team. You canâ€™t rely on body language or sitting next to people, so you lose half the soft skills we frequently rely on in product management. But it hasnâ€™t mattered one bit. Iâ€™ve found that 30-minute video calls have been polite and intimate, and Iâ€™ve had to focus on clear language.</p><p>One thing that really helped me start getting my feet under the table was the <a href="https://twitter.com/rossferg/status/960974335002468353">product manager induction Trello board that Ross created</a> a couple of years ago. I iterated it slightly, which made it a little more effective so Iâ€™ll write a blog post about that.</p><p>Iâ€™m working on two teams: one focusing on migrating to <a href="https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk">Platform as a Service</a>, and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen">kaizen</a> team focusing on continually improving the product and our processes. For strategy work, Iâ€™m looking at Direct Debits.</p><p>Next week weâ€™ll try some team sessions, to gather peopleâ€™s thoughts and collaborate on setting objectives. Itâ€™ll be different, for sure, but with a <a href="https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/flies'/quotes/symbol/the-conch/">conch system</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVZPh8Zz8lw&amp;feature=youtu.be">jamboards</a>, I reckon weâ€™ll be fine.</p><p>Wednesdayâ€™s Show &amp; Tell was so good, packed with really excellent work. Thinking back, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d ever read a weeknote from Pay, so I asked if we could put one together. Itâ€™s really important that GaaP products and their successes stay on the executive teamâ€™s radar, so that solving common problems across government remains the strategy.</p><p>My notebook is packed full of scribblings that I need to turn into sensible notes or things to do. Probably need to take a few hours on Sunday to work through it.</p><p>TfL and the BBC have released some virtual backgrounds for your Zoom calls, <a href="https://londonblog.tfl.gov.uk/2020/05/01/video-conference-backgrounds/">scenes on London transport</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/empty_sets_collection/zfvy382">empty sets from TV shows</a>. Itâ€™s a really neat touch from the public service orgs. I wondered what a GDS virtual background might be: maybe just a bunch of Post-its on the wall of some hallowed Cabinet Office room.</p><p>The contact tracing app has got everyone talking about privacy, interoperability and centralised vs decentralised data models, which is really good. Apple and Google proposed and built decentralised models distinctly because theyâ€™ve been criticised for their approach to privacy before, and Iâ€™m surprised that the government doesnâ€™t just follow the tech giants â€“ theyâ€™ve got way more resources to test these approaches out. So it makes me angry to read that money is being spent on creating a second contact tracing app with a decentralised model, â€˜in case politicians decide to make a switchâ€™. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p><p>Although it looks like <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahtgold/status/1258676392620888067">some of the data permissions patterns are being figured out by NHS</a> rather than GDS, which is good to see.</p><h2 id="not-work-stuff">Not-work stuff</h2><p>Our world and the characters weâ€™re creating in our Fate Core game are coming along really well, and I think weâ€™ll play our first session this weekend.

Although I had to stop reading it two chapters in because my pre-order of <em>Ghost Hardware</em> by Tim Maugham came through. So after a brief stint in Bristol, suffused with sub-bass, Iâ€™ll return to New Delhi.</p><p>I picked up some gems on <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-covid-19-fundraiser">Bandcamp Day</a>, buying some of the albums I liked most from last year. <a href="https://sneakersocialclub.bandcamp.com/album/halcyon-daze">Soundbwoy Killah</a>, <a href="https://whities.bandcamp.com/album/whities-019">Overmono</a>, <a href="https://iliantape.bandcamp.com/album/itlp04-skee-mask-compro">Skee Mask</a>, <a href="https://punchdrunkrecords.bandcamp.com/album/ashley-road-sessions-88-94">Smith &amp; Mighty</a> and <a href="https://leegamble.bandcamp.com/album/diversions-1994-1996">Lee Gamble</a> all got some Â£Â£Â£s.
