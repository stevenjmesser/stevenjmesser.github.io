I feel like Iâ€™m crawling out of the mire of the past few months which, though it had both ups and downs, has been really bloody tough. It was also comforting to hear from a colleague that product managers more experienced than myself would have struggled with what we were asked to do. So thatâ€™s given me a renewed optimism.</p><h2 id="good-things">Good things</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/dasbarrett">Dan</a> and I had a long overdue coffee at the Barbican, which was a nice spot for a rainy Monday. Kudos to Dan for picking there. We chatted about food, music, digital public services, data, data standards, machine learning, and other assorted good things.</p><p>We presented at the GOV.UK Show &amp; Tell, the first of the year, about what weâ€™re up to currently. It felt like this was the first time weâ€™ve had anything comprehensive to put forward, as so much of our work over the past few months has been thinking rather than doing. But people seemed interested in the work and it came as a comfort to put it out in the open. (Iâ€™d love to do the same on here but I am held back somewhat by the comms grid and controlling of narrative.)</p><p>Leanne, Head of Product, also presented GOV.UKâ€™s future strategy to the other product managers and designers on the programme. This is not just good but great because my team (and the programme team) have been working on it for a while, but no one else had yet seen the detail. And you know what? It landed well, I think. There were plenty of useful, insightful comments but thatâ€™s the beauty of sharing it. Itâ€™s also nice to know that things weâ€™ve imagineered or <a href="https://public.digital/2018/09/25/making-government-as-a-platform-real/">repackaged</a> make sense to our peers. So now we can get on with doing it.</p><p>The first check-in of the year with the programme team went really well, theyâ€™re bought into our missionâ€™s goals.</p><h2 id="learned-things">Learned things</h2><p>Talking about our work with the rest of the GOV.UK-as-a-service team (mapping out what we do now, so we can decide how to support things in future) was hugely cathartic.
