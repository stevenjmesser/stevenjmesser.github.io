We’re clearly on the right track – it was a very positive session – and we have made the uncertain more certain early on, but we exposed issues around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">dev VM</a>. Our developers have to download a lot of data to emulate www.gov.uk on their virtual machines, which means they often run out of disk space, but this problem is compounded when you’re having to load large search indexes too. It’s a programme-wide problem and we’re not the only team facing this issue, but it is more acute for our developers.</p><p>We’d heard word that <a href="https://github.com/cbaines">Chris</a> had developed a way to take a slice of the data, meaning you needn’t load everything, but weren’t entirely sure the scripts existed. He had previously put together mini-environments though and I asked whether we could explore that too.</p><p>I asked whether we might be moving too fast, as I didn’t want us to miss any important details, but everyone thought were moving at a fine speed. This was improved later in the week when meeting the AWS Migration team. They were planning on migrating <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/rummager">Rummager</a>, our search API, but have had to focus on other parts of the infrastructure. Our roadmaps align though and they should be ready to help us route traffic from dependencies to the new <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/search-api">Search API</a> once it’s up and running.</p><p>And finally I filled in a massive, gigantic spreadsheet charting our costs for search functionality over the next three years. As Liz Sarginson, our deputy director for Technical Operations, said: ‘Product managers should know the costs and financial effects of their decisions.’</p><h3 id="two">Two</h3><p>We’re getting a programme-wide roadmap put together, and I shaped how we might improve our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_pipeline">product pipeline</a>. Currently we have support tickets lumped in with feedback and feature requests, which means we’re mixing together the ‘I want to report a broken thing’ tickets with the ‘I want to know how to do a thing’ tickets. And the ‘I want to be able to do a new thing’ tickets get barely any time spent exploring the problem area.</p><p>My proposal is to look into our current models for support, ongoing user testing, feedback and triage, aiming to quanitfy the operations and expose the pain points. We need to collect qualitative data on how this has been handled at other organisations and agencies, and I’ve some experience of doing this at NOW TV and Porism. (My pipeline for eCasework was really slick and meant our user retention went up, because user felt like they were being listened to.) We’re in need of a good knowledge base too, or at least some rules around making sure it’s updated. Too much of our product knowledge is stored up in people’s heads, which is not helpful when new people join the programme or move across product areas.</p><p>After that, I’d like to look at how we work more closely with departments and end users, the next layer of the gumball: collecting and validating user needs, lean testing and research models, onsite observation for innovation, guerilla UX testing and other methods for improving our new product development.
