Itâ€™ll be released in the open shortly, but this is the first time in about six months that weâ€™ve had a roadmap up and on the wall.

Weâ€™re keen to explore how governmentâ€™s agile and digital methods have seeped into other sectors; Iâ€™ve certainly been to conferences where the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles">Design Principles</a> are lauded highly and Governmentâ€™s approach to creating a <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk">Design System</a> has been copied.

Itâ€™s been kinda tough joining an established team and trying to tweak some of its habits, removing some of the bad behaviours, but thereâ€™s definitely been lessons on both sides. Itâ€™s easy to waste those lessons and not act on them, so sitting down and pulling out good aspects and things to work on gives us objectives for improving next quarter.</p><p>The one bad thing was that despite peopleâ€™s regular complaints, weâ€™d not actively done anything to improve remote-working for the team.
