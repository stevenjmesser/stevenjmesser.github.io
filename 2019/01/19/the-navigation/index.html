Weâ€™re looking at three specific problems in the problem space: our <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> is out-of-support and needs upgrading; managing our clusters is costly on time and takes us away from feature work; and knowledge of Elasticsearch is low throughout the programme.</p><p>Our small but excellent team started by getting Elasticsearch 5.x and 6.x running on their local machines, importing data and noting the differences.

Tricky technical work deserves some thinking space, so metering everyoneâ€™s expectations upfront should hopefully mean no one laments slowing down.</p><p>Our main key result: performance and resilience is not degraded.</p><h3 id="two">Two</h3><p>My other new team, Explore Personalisation, also kicked off the quarter! Our initial meeting provided us with a bunch of questions to answer, to help us work out the unknowns. Getting a feel for the problem space is one of the essential first steps for a product team, so weâ€™ve lots of interviews and desk research lined up. As mentioned before, Iâ€™ll not go into too much detail on this work as itâ€™s sensitive and weâ€™ll be blogging about it (plus publishing our research for others to use).</p><p>Product managing this work is important for me because, up until now, Iâ€™ve been on a very technical product team at GDS. This is a discovery with myriad possibilities, many loud opinions both in the team and battering us from external stakeholders, and balances vision leadership with the current climate around privacy ethics. My history on Platform Health risks me being pigeonholed as a technical product manager and, whilst Iâ€™m not afraid of getting into that complex work, this is a chance to showcase my other skills.</p><h3 id="three">Three</h3><p>We pulled out some questions to help us start forming a roadmap for core products. Thatâ€™s mostly the applications in the publishing pipeline, authentication, other backends and some cross-product experiences that donâ€™t sit elsewhere. As GOV.UK continues to scale, taking on more government bodies, publishers and serving more people, itâ€™s going to need a bit of operationalisation and programme-wide strategy. For example, if our Publishing product group want to start doing fancy new things, weâ€™ll need to guide them based on whatâ€™s possible now and where the overall platform is headed. We need to build up some data, research our colleagues and form a vision for where weâ€™re headed in the coming weeks â€“ thatâ€™s for next week though.</p><h3 id="four">Four</h3><p>I learned how techniques for dealing with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/10/26/data-driven-decision-making-beware-of-the-hippo-effect/">HiPPOs</a> donâ€™t always work. People whose bread and butter is making demands canâ€™t be reasoned with during tense moments. This is where knowledge work rubs up against authority bias, where evidence and lean methods lose out to solutionism and senior demands. Itâ€™s bullshit.</p><p>Having said that, we <em>are</em> in unprecedented times and whoâ€™s to say that one way is the best to navigate through? It might be the case that features based on little evidence work, though Iâ€™ve not seen that happen often. People with a high degree of domain knowledge can often make instinctive decisions that turn out to be successes â€“ Steve Jobs was great at this. But itâ€™s hard to make reasoned, objective decisions in domains where one has very little knowledge of the intricacies and the environment. Strong product teams exist â€˜to serve the [users], in ways that meet the needs of the [organisation]â€™, as Marty Cagan says in <a href="https://svpg.com/empowered-product-teams/">this piece</a>, and they donâ€™t operate well under â€˜command and controlâ€™ management.
