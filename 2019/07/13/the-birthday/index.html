Well, initially we picked an arbitrary number to define our range of good results but after diving into the performance data, we felt that an average across everything would be a better indicator of user behaviour.</p><p>We’re aiming to make results better for queries like <a href="https://www.gov.uk/search/all?keywords=take+my+pet+abroad&amp;order=relevance">‘take my pet abroad’</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/search/all?keywords=change+my+licence&amp;order=relevance">‘change my licence’</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/search/all?keywords=statement+on+libya&amp;order=relevance">‘statement on libya’</a> which have some oddities amongst the OK results (see if you can spot them!).

I’m continuing as product manager for GOV.UK’s site search working with a team of excellent developers, performance analysts, a data scientist and a designer to make site search work smarter for users. I’ve explained what that means in a blog post, but there’s three immediate problems to fix.\n\n\n I also wrote about how I kick off new quarters with a product team.\n\n\nSearch results relevancy\n\n58 per cent of searches on GOV.UK provide decent results with most users clicking one of the top 3.18 results, but results for the remaining 42 per cent range from OK to Awful. We’re going to make that better.\n\nBut why 3.18? Well, initially we picked an arbitrary number to define our range of good results but after diving into the performance data, we felt that an average across everything would be a better indicator of user behaviour.\n\nWe’re aiming to make results better for queries like ‘take my pet abroad’, ‘change my licence’ and ‘statement on libya’ which have some oddities amongst the OK results (see if you can spot them!). To do this, we’re tweaking our search engine and algorithm and using multivariate (A/B) testing to compare the performance on live searches.\n\nAccessibility on mobile\n\nThe search experience on GOV.UK is fragmented – it’s just not consistent across the site or across devices. We’ve started work on this before but not been able to finish it, meaning the frontend is bulky and performs particularly badly on mobile phones.\n\n\n\nThis is bad because the number of searches performed on mobiles has increased by 19 per cent from 6,345,649 sessions in 2017 to 7,574,196 sessions in 2018 – a trend we see across the entire website.\n\nSo we’re going to apply Mark’s new designs taking a holistic view across the site, and make our search frontend accessible before the new regulations require us to in 2020.\n\nSite search is ‘dumb’\n\nPeople’s mental models for how search should work are set by Google, and through the Voice work we’ve learned more about how people ask questions of government.\n\nHowever, we don’t get analytics from voice assistants; we can’t see charts for what people are asking Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant.\n\nWe can, though, see that users are asking intelligent queries in site search, like ‘5 months pregnant and homeless need help’.

He’s a top guy. We chatted about work stuff, obvs, but also cybernetics, comics and graphic novels, physics, sailing analogies, being a chef, heritage, belonging and loads of other stuff.
