I mostly followed <a href="https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/overview">Googleâ€™s Design Sprint kit</a> to plan the session but used some of our own workshops rather than theirs. We only had 3 hours to think about this feature so couldnâ€™t spend ages explaining new workshop techniques.</p><p>Weâ€™re thinking of introducing autocomplete suggestions because it helps users get to a more relevant query or the results theyâ€™re looking for faster, reducing the interaction cost. For example, someone may search for â€˜taxâ€™, need a very specific piece of guidance about vehicle tax and is forced to refine their search until they hit the right results. This costs the user time (and patience), and we can reduce the interaction cost by suggesting queries or content to users before their query is submitted.</p><p>The team did an excellent job of researching how autocomplete is implemented on other sitesâ€™ search. Particularly surprising was <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/">IKEA</a>, which suggests completed queries, actual products, site categories and additional content when you search for something like â€˜lightâ€™. Theyâ€™ve clearly thought about the different jobs-to-be-done and how the navigational journeys for those interplay, whereas most places will just complete your query or take you to a particular section of the site, leaving you as a user to figure the rest out.</p><p>The team scoped out some great hypotheses, affinity-mapped the useful aspects to each implementation, wrote some good user stories and had a think about which assumptions we needed to validate with our own implementation of such a feature. They used <a href="https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase3-sketch/crazy-eights">Crazy-8s</a> to think about the different ways it could be designed on GOV.UK.</p><p>Jeremy, our interaction designer, is taking it all away to design a few prototypes which will help us validate our assumptions. We think that autocomplete should be contextual to where you are, as currently the site search bar works the same everywhere (except for searching inside manuals). We also think that query suggestions are useful but oftentimes a service or piece of guidance would be a better suggestion</p><h3 id="two">Two</h3><p><a href="https://theodi.org/person/peter-wells/">Peter</a> and <a href="https://theodi.org/person/jared-keller/">Jared</a> came in to chat about <a href="https://theodi.org/project/the-data-access-map/">data access models</a> and a designerly approach to exploring data-sharing methods.
