I missed working on the Search team over the past few weeks, itâ€™s such an interesting problem space.

By the end of the week, I was able to write this in the GOV.UK internal weeknote.</p><blockquote><p>Search have brought back <a href="https://www.gov.uk/search/all?keywords=highlighted&amp;order=relevance">highlighted search terms</a> to site search. They added it to finders and prototyped and built <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/finder-frontend/pull/1554">spelling suggestions</a> ready for release soon. They also drafted a build-and-release plan for the improved mobile search UI, stopped last weekâ€™s A/B test and started another â€“ theyâ€™re inches close to switching to ES6 entirely! The team continued refactoring Finder Frontend and rewrote some of its queries to perform 50x faster, as well as adding support for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/search/all?keywords=office+%22banter%22&amp;order=relevance">mixing quoted and unquoted query fragments</a>, upgrading Golang apps and improving sitemaps so that Google crawls us more often.</p></blockquote><p>So thatâ€™s what the team did. But what did <em>I</em> do?! Mostly I spent the week thinking about our objectives, milestones in the strategy, how we measure success/know when weâ€™re done, and the different activities the team go through to reach those goals. Itâ€™s important to be thinking about this because, as a programme, GOV.UK is moving away from how quarterly planning has become established in GDS to something else.</p><p>The problem with quarterly planning is that it made everyone think in terms of quarters and it caused some people to be shifted around every three months. Thatâ€™s process over people, the antithesis of agile development, and isnâ€™t helpful. Iâ€™ve always told the Search team not to think in terms of quarters â€“ the work is only ever done when value is delivered to users. So in our case, the work will probably never be done because site search can always be improved.</p><p>Lean methods feel more comfortable to me, and I also find thinking in terms of OKRs helpful, so Iâ€™ve always tried to frame the teamâ€™s work using vision, objectives, key results and milestones. Sprints have goals which play into these, but we donâ€™t have a traditional roadmap of things to deliver, itâ€™s all about outcomes.</p><p>Having checked on everything weâ€™re doing and the way weâ€™re doing it, I feel comfortable that the framework is laid down.
