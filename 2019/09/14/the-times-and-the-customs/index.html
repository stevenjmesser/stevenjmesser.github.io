Turns out they’d done a lot. They’d tested a prototype of the new mobile search interface at King’s Cross, started making inroads on tuning the search algorithm to provide more relevant results, and made a start on some other features too.

Having built a new endpoint for the Email Alert API that can accept messages and send those to a pre-built list, work is dying down. Most of the week was spent documenting from both a technical and product viewpoint, so that anyone else can pick up the work. Further iterations will surface out of user research and feedback, but those won’t need a whole team working on it every day.
