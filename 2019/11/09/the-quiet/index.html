I covered 5,216 miles by bike, mostly commuting to work and back, and burned a fair few calories. It was a happy time. One lunchtime I even <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/552355228">rode out to Clerkenwell to grab some artichokes</a>, from a bloke who brought them back from his nonna’s garden in Italy.</p><p>But last year I spent less time on my bike (460 miles) and this year has been spent mostly on buses.</p><p>My mood hit a low point this week.

For example, Android being open source.</p></blockquote><p>They’re useful concepts to bear in mind when having to make trade-offs in your everyday work, as they show how some decisions can force you down certain paths. It’s useful to step back every once in a while and think ‘OK, how does this contribute to the overall direction and getting closer to our vision?’ Is the endgame you’ll now reach the one that everyone is working towards?</p><h2 id="exploration-discovery-and-uncertain-futures">Exploration, discovery and uncertain futures</h2><p>Will Myddleton has written some really good stuff about <a href="https://www.myddelton.co.uk/blog/three-ways-to-run-better-discoveries">running discoveries</a> and how they’re scary as we’re <a href="https://www.myddelton.co.uk/blog/better-discoveries">exploring uncertain futures</a>.</p><p>One bit that struck a chord with me was about creating a safe space for discovery:</p><blockquote><p>If discovery scares people (it does) then we need to find ways to make a safe space for discoveries to happen.
