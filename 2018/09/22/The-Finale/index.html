(This weekâ€™s image is NASA research mathematician Katherine Johnson, whose story and work the film covers.)</p><p>We went for lunch to try and work out our development approach but ended up talking about people. Weâ€™re blessed with some excellent developers on our team, but one project has been unfortunately siloed and losing its lead would be a detriment. <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20121211-00/?p=5863">V-teams</a> have their own cadence, despite how fast your own part moves.

I do love working at GDS and feel blessed to work on GOV.UK, but frankly Iâ€™m oblivious as to how much of that can be credited to the current management. Could be loads, could be little, Iâ€™ve honestly no idea. Regardless, theyâ€™re doing their bit and I get paid each month, so I canâ€™t complain. Itâ€™s essential, though, that we sustain the grassroots start-up culture and people have space to do their best work.

Those come from a mixture of sources: tech debt, other mission work, ideas from 2nd Line shifts, and good olâ€™ regular forward-thinking.

It was mostly getting to grips with <a href="https://www.tableau.com">Tableau</a>, a data analysis and visualisation tool, which is really good. You simply feed it a CSV or open data API endpoint and itâ€™ll work out the measures and dimensions, allowing you to build visualisations quickly. You can create calculated measures too, adding new levels of analysis on top of the raw dataset. If youâ€™re at all curious about data science, what it is and how to do it, the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/share/1000juBUMeeFZRTX4=/">Data Science A-Zâ„¢</a> course on Udemy is the one weâ€™re taking and would fill a weekend comfortably.</p><p>That got me thinking about what projects we could start during the course. Iâ€™m intrigued to know if the way content is arranged on our <a href="https://www.blog.gov.uk">blogs platform</a> makes a difference to performance metrics. For example, does fewer paragraphs under headings affect scroll depth? Do blog posts with images receive more traffic, and, if so, do pictures of people or diagrams make a difference?
