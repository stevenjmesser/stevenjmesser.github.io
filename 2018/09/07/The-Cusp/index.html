Itâ€™s a headtrip to operate that way. For most of the quarter weâ€™ve been working from a physical board, but as weâ€™re nearing the end of that and thereâ€™s no board for next quarter, you have to keep everything in your head. That saps energy, and itâ€™s something to learn from for next quarter.</p><p>A busy week with lots of brain-thinking stuff and tiredness, but hereâ€™s what we did.</p><h2 id="five-things-thathappened">Five Things ThatÂ Happened</h2><p><em>We did more things than this</em></p><h3 id="one">One</h3><p>I went over how our content designer, Mark, helped DExEU publish the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/technicalnotices">technical notices</a>, to understand the user behaviour behind publishing those documents. Thereâ€™s more to come from government and we want to be prepared to help deliver that information. He placed trust in scheduling a publication which not all users do, so thatâ€™s one area to keep an eye.</p><p>Iâ€™ve been assuming thereâ€™s some work to be done to build back publishersâ€™ trust in the publishing system as a whole, but validating that could be tough. However, thereâ€™s other mission teams on GOV.UK looking after publisher workflows and theyâ€™ll likely be looking into satisfaction ratings. Having said that, itâ€™s an opportunity to get in front of users on a team that rarely has face-to-face contact with our publishing community.</p><h3 id="two">Two</h3><p>The first PM community session organised by ProductBuro went well â€“ I think. Yay! Iain gave a good talk about metrics, reminding us that we can go back to basics and choose to observe the signals that tell us weâ€™re solving problems. Afterwards we had a chat about long run indicators, <a href="https://weeknot.es/weeknotes-s01e02-81f7c23f5bb5">something which Iâ€™ve touched on previously</a> thanks to a Product for Good meet-up. For example, a good metric to measure the value of GOV.UK is a reduction in contact volume to call centres.</p><p>Given thereâ€™s lots of chat about KPIs, measuring value and <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/news-parliament-2017/digital-government-inquiry-launch-17-19/">general wondering about whether Government Digital Service is worth it</a>, articulating the difference between short term performance measurement and long term impact assessment could be quite pertinent.</p><h3 id="three">Three</h3><p>Meeting other product managers across the community is always interesting, especially when government causes our practice to be warped from the norm.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/lisa_e_scott">Lisa</a> organised an unprecedented Product People meet-up in Londonâ€¦or at least Iâ€™ve never been to one so busy, with so many speakers! We heard from product managers at HMRC, MoJ, GDS and CQC about product management on a non-software team. Developing policy is different to developing a product, but the tools you use and how you describe success, how people drive outcomes, is almost identical. It comes down to the tenets of product management: an understanding of users and a desire for fight for their needs, an understanding of the organisation and a willingness to involve their insights, and an understanding of the mechanics of your problem space. If you donâ€™t mind being Chief Antagonist, youâ€™ll be all right.</p><p>Afterwards I got to meet the inimitable Rose Waite who co-founded the Product People meet-up (sheâ€™s written about <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/08/29/tips-on-how-to-set-up-and-maintain-your-own-community/">how Product People got started and how to maintain a community</a>), and she spoke of the revolution within government that is indicative of transformation. Iâ€™m wondering whether weâ€™re entering a second generation of that movement, as the <em>avant-garde</em> move on in great numbers, and how we sustain the momentum. Thereâ€™s OneTeamGov, yes, but if your direct leadership team isnâ€™t a part of it, what then?</p><blockquote><p>Do @ me, I know the weeknotes community will have valuable thoughts on this.</p></blockquote><h3 id="four">Four</h3><p>I brought about 45 per cent of myself to work one day. Partly a result of falling asleep on the sofa accidentally, rousing from slumber by the cat at 2 a.m., then plodding to bed. Waking again 2 hours later, lain upright with a crick in my neck from too many pillows was a further dint. Trying to push through any day on little sleep, let alone a busy one in the final third of a quarter, is really tough.</p><p>But thankfully weâ€™re gifted with flexible working at Government Digital Service. Tomorrow I can work from Wales (WFW) in any place with a table and WiFi. This kind of flexibility, which enables one to work hard but adjust their environs based on circumstance, operates beneath a layer of trust. And itâ€™s not something to be taken for granted. I can have a full nightâ€™s rest, in a silent village, and still work on complex problems tomorrow.</p><p>We engineer our working lives to make optimal achievements, but underneath it all weâ€™re just humans with unquantified, organic machinery. Sometimes natureâ€™s signals are the best alerts to monitor.</p><p>Aside from all that, I was grateful to Joe â€“ a senior business analyst looking at KPIs across our programmes â€“ for reaching out and asking for more time to chat through something. Weâ€™d left a chance conversation the previous day unfinished and it needed a conclusion; he stepped up and heard me out.</p><h3 id="five">Five</h3><p>Also, I got a bit sad we hadnâ€™t been able to achieve a load on the pipeline work. But I was reminded that we have lots on, and thereâ€™s still time left. Thankfully everyoneâ€™s enthused with the work and wants to do more, and Iâ€™m looking forward to forming a final productive push. Iâ€™m getting together with our technical lead and a senior dev on Monday to shape the stories, and weâ€™ll put them in front of the team when thereâ€™s room on the quarterly roadmap.</p><h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2><ul><li>Research is good, but some times you wonâ€™t learn anything new</li><li>We still need a way to look into turning qualitative comments into quantitative metrics</li><li>Sometimes natureâ€™s signals are the best alerts to monitor â€“ take time for you</li></ul><h2 id="what-imreading">What Iâ€™mÂ Reading</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-wants-to-kill-the-url/">Google Wants to Kill the URL</a></li><li><a href="https://contentinsights.com/blog/from-data-driven-to-data-informed-why-the-distinction-matters/">From data-driven to data-informed: why the distinction matters</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@benwerd/rules-for-resters-809e368c0fdb">Rules for Resters</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@asuffield/defining-an-slo-6302f60b218a">Defining an SLO</a></li></ul></div><ul class="post__social"><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://visitmy.website/2018/09/07/The-Cusp/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?&text=The Cusp+https://visitmy.website/2018/09/07/The-Cusp/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://visitmy.website/2018/09/07/The-Cusp/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-google-plus"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&source=The Cusp&summary=Weâ€™re in a liminal zone, a headspace between two periods but only present physically in one.
