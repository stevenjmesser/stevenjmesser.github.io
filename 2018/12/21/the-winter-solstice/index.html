Iâ€™m going to be working over Christmas so this series hasnâ€™t ended yet, but this week was definitely a major milestone. Itâ€™s time to tie off some loose ends and prepare for 2019, as next year will be hectic. Hopefully my weeknotes wonâ€™t suffer as a result but since <a href="https://weeknot.es">people who are busier and better than me</a> manage it, Iâ€™ll always have them to turn to for advice.</p><h2 id="five-things-that-happened">Five Things That Happened</h2><p><em>We did more things than this</em></p><h3 id="one">One</h3><p>I kicked off <em>another</em> new team, although not one that Iâ€™ll be managing from day to day. Its mission is to look at another of our key results in Platform Health, a particularly risky one around EU Exit, ensuring that we can handle a spike in departments publishing content concurrently. Itâ€™s a pretty complex space trying to work out the efficiencies of a distributed publishing pipeline of micro-services, but we made a good start.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/steventux">Steve</a> is Tech Lead which is perfect, as heâ€™s an excellent full stack developer who has a deep knowledge of www.gov.uk and how it has evolved over time. After talking through the mission and setting an objective, I covered some of the cards weâ€™d completed in other sprints, spikes into how weâ€™d collect data on publishing activity and how weâ€™d replay that to the pipeline. The biggest hurdle to overcome was figuring out how to replay fake publishing events, and Steveâ€™s managed to use Gatling to do that. Thatâ€™s a huge achievement and means the mission can actually progress now. It <em>is</em> possible. Weâ€™re not sure whether to use Gor or logs data to replicate publishing events but thatâ€™s something to look at next week.</p><p>I should probably write a full guide on how I kick off a digital team in government. Iâ€™ve done it twice in the last three weeks, beyond the usual quarter kick-offs for Platform Health, and a few elements worked really well, so itâ€™d be good to have those to turn to. No doubt others out there could add their tidbits too.</p><h3 id="two">Two</h3><p>We deployed all the OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE stuff weâ€™d been working on, so that people and businesses can find information on how exiting the EU will affect them. Thereâ€™s a <a href="https://euexit.campaign.gov.uk">campaign</a> which points to new content on www.gov.uk, all of which has been through rapid cycles of prototyping, user testing and iteration. A journalist put out a <a href="https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/1075701805521231873">red-hot take</a> that UK government was trying to catch up to the Dutch government, as the Dutch did a similar-but-not-the-same thing a few months ago, although the Dutch one spits out a PDF of information that could change. Ours, however, can be updated as policy develops and you can subscribe to email alerts about changes specific to your context.</p><p>All that aside, itâ€™s testament to our ways of working and the value that GOV.UK provides that weâ€™re able to design, build and release these useful tools and information inside of four weeks. It would have been released sooner had <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46509288">the vote on the deal in Parliament</a> not been delayed. So ignoring the political situation and what we were delivering, it turns out that being lean and agile works for making stuff happen.</p><h3 id="three">Three</h3><p>In the middle of that day, a day of team ceremonies and the EU Exit Deployathon, I had an interview. Having been worried about it last week, GDS came to their senses and scheduled an interview before Christmas. I made sure to talk about things I had done rather than what we had done as a team, because they called me out on that at HMRC. It went well, I bigged myself up, and they did tons of nodding. But mostly Iâ€™ll cherish having casually strolled into an interview during some important, stressful work. (I know thatâ€™s very egotistical but it is quite rare, let me bask in it!)</p><h3 id="four">Four</h3><p>Chatted with other PMs and our new Head of Product, Leanne, about our missions for next quarter. Iâ€™m leaving my work-family, Platform Health, to start two new teams: Search &amp; Finders Resilience, continuing the work we did on dynamic content performance; and Personalisation, looking at whether users want personalised experiences and how that might benefit them.</p><p>Working on Personalisation is going to be great. Weâ€™ve got the Head of User Insights, <a href="https://twitter.com/Imeh_Akpan">Imeh</a>, and Senior Service Designer, <a href="https://twitter.com/KateIW">Kate</a>, working with us, two of the most talented folk on GOV.UK. Plus Leanne was massively involved in personalisation at Sky, so sheâ€™ll have some good ideas, but itâ€™s working with stakeholders that Iâ€™m also really excited about.</p><p>Users have a mental model around giving government their personal data, which can largely be summarised by â€˜ERM, NO F***ING WAYâ€™. Thatâ€™s going to be our first thing to explore, as itâ€™s the major blocker to personalisation ever being a thing. Despite some senior civil servants, MPs and <a href="https://policyexchange.org.uk/publication/the-smart-state/">think tanks</a> saying that GOV.UK needs this feature, we donâ€™t much like spending taxpayersâ€™ money on things they donâ€™t need â€“ so weâ€™ll validate that first. On top of that, <a href="https://twitter.com/gansenthi">Ganesh</a> and I will be doing a side project on the Semantic Web and Linked Data, to get GOV.UK into the shape it really needs to be. If youâ€™re reading this and I know you <em>and</em> you have worked on Semantic technologies in the past, expect to receive an email soon. (But if youâ€™re a Semantic person and I donâ€™t know you, please drop me a line!)</p><p>Though itâ€™s a little sad to be leaving Platform Health, Iâ€™m looking forward to working on a UX product after 9 months in the technical trenches. Itâ€™s going to be in good hands though, and theyâ€™ve got more complex work coming up that I can follow from the other side of the office.</p><h3 id="five">Five</h3><p>Oh, and it turns out the interview went well. They offered me the promotion and Iâ€™m going to take it, because I really like working on that website. An early Christmas present!</p><h2 id="reflections">Reflections</h2><h3 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h3><p>That 2019 may be even more exciting and move more quickly than 2018.</p><h3 id="what-i-could-do-better">What I Could Do Better</h3><p>This week was absolutely fine, but Iâ€™m going to have to get anal about managing my time and focus. With so many plates to spin, Iâ€™ll need to work hard to make sure we meet all our objectives.</p><h2 id="reading">Reading</h2><ul><li><a href="https://futurism.com/futuristic-funeral-death-die/">7 Futuristic Things To Do With Your Body When You Die</a></li><li><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-we-do-when-facebook-youtube-crash/">Infoporn: Facebook or YouTube Down?
